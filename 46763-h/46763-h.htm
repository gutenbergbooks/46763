<h2 class="no-break">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>"Tyndall, I must remain plain Michael Faraday
to the last." In these words, with which he
replied to Professor Tyndall's urgent appeal to him
to accept the Presidency of the Royal Society, we
have a key-note to the character of the illustrious
yet modest scientist, the good and great man, whose
life-story I have attempted to tell in the following
pages.</p>

<p>A life-story such as that of Michael Faraday is
both easy and difficult to tell&mdash;it is easy in that he
passed a simple and unadventurous life; it is difficult,
partly, perhaps, for the same reason, and partly
because the story of his life-work is a story of the
wonderful advance made in natural science during
the first half of the present century. Any detailed
account of that scientific work would be out of place in
a biography such as the present, which aims at showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
by the testimony of those who knew him and by
an account of his relations with his fellow-men, how
nobly unselfish, how simple, yet how grand and useful,
was the long life of Michael Faraday.</p>

<p>Besides this, we are shown&mdash;how many an illustrious
name in the bede-roll of our great men brings
it to mind&mdash;that with an enthusiastic love for
a particular study, and unflagging perseverance in
pursuance of it, the most adverse circumstance of
birth and fortune may be overcome, and he who
has striven take rank among the great and good
whose names adorn the annals of their country.
Such lives are useful, not alone for the work which
is done, but for the example which they afford us,
that we also&mdash;to use Longfellow's well-known, yet
beautifully true lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent17">"May make our lives sublime,</div>
<div class="verse">And departing, leave behind us</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Footprints on the sands of time."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"The true scientist," says Mr. Robert Buchanan
in a recent work, "should be patient like Darwin
and reverent like Faraday." The latter, indeed,
seems to me to have been a truly typical scientist.
Never have we seen an instance of a less selfish
devotion to a man's chosen work. Born the son of
a journeyman blacksmith, brought up amidst the
most unpromising surroundings, with but the scantiest
schooling, we find Michael Faraday educating himself
during his spare time, and gradually acquiring, by
indomitable perseverance, that scientific knowledge
for which he thirsted. We find him seeking employment,
even in the humblest capacity, in a place that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
must have appeared to his youthful mind as the
very home of science. Once there, we find him
advancing with marvellous rapidity not only in the
acquirement of knowledge which had been gained
by others, but, yet prouder position, we find him
ever adding to that store of knowledge the discovery
of new facts. The patience of the true scientist was
assuredly his. We find him acknowledged by his
great contemporaries not only as an equal but as a
leader among them. We find him with wealth and
high social position within his reach. All this do
we find&mdash;and not this alone; for we find him at
the same time unspoiled in the slightest degree by
his success; caring not in the least for the wealth
that might be his, and declining honours which
most men would have considered as but the fair
reward of work which they had done. We find him
also the object of love and admiration, not of his
family and intimate friends alone, but of all persons
with whom he came into contact. We find him exploring
all the hidden workings of nature&mdash;making
known discovery after discovery in the same modest
and enthusiastic manner; and despite all these
inquiries into the secrets of nature, we find him
retaining unshaken that firm faith with which he
had started&mdash;that beautiful and unquestioning trust
in</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">"A far off divine event</div>
<div class="verse">To which the whole creation moves."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Much of Faraday's kindliness and good nature,
his considerateness and his simple earnest faith could
be revealed only by his letters and by the records of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
those who had known him personally&mdash;on this account
I have found it necessary somewhat freely to make
use of illustrative quotations. After studying his
life, however, the kindliness, nay more, the true
brotherhood of the man with all men is the feeling
which most firmly clings to us; we do not alone
remember the great electrician, experimentalist, and
lecturer, but we have an ever-present idea of the
sterling goodness of the man.</p>

<p>"A purer, less selfish, more stainless existence,
has rarely been witnessed. At last came the voice
which the dying alone can hear, and the hand which
the living may not see, beckoned him away; and then
that noble intellect, awakening from its lethargy,
like some sleeper roused from a heavy dream, rose up
and passed through the gates of light into the better
land, where, doubtless, it is now immersed in the
study of grander mysteries than it ever attempted to
explore on earth."</p>

<p>In closing this preface I have much pleasure in
recording my deep indebtedness to Miss Jane Barnard,
a niece of the great Professor, and for some two and
twenty years a member of his household, for several
reminiscences of her uncle; and also for her kindness
in allowing me to look through the many interesting
manuscripts of Faraday's which are in her possession.</p>

<p>Among those of our great men who, born in humble circumstances
and unfurnished with the benefits of early
education, have yet secured for themselves honourable
positions in the history of the world's progress, Michael
Faraday holds a remarkable place. Born the son of a
journeyman blacksmith, Michael yet gained for himself
a conspicuous position among the very first scientists of
his day, and at the time of his death was acknowledged
as one of the leading philosophers&mdash;electricians&mdash;chemists&mdash;of
this nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Our interest in a great man makes us always interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
also in his family&mdash;we become anxious to know
who and what he was apart from that which has made
him great. Who were his parents? from where did
they come? what were they like? what did they do?
and a number of similar questions are at once started
as soon as we commence considering the lives of our
"great and good." In the case of Faraday we have
only scanty information as to his family, but thus much
we have gleaned:&mdash;</p>

<p>During the whole of last century there was living in
or near the village of Clapham, in Yorkshire, a family of
the name of Faraday. Between the years 1708 and
1730 the Clapham parish register shows us that
"Richard ffaraday, stonemason, tiler, and separatist,"
recorded the births of ten children, and it is probable
that he had in his large family yet another son, Robert.
Whether, however, Robert was his son or only his
nephew is a matter of doubt, but it is known of him
that he married Elizabeth Dean, the possessor of
a small though comfortable house called Clapham
Wood Hall, and that he was the father of ten children,
one of whom, James, was born in 1761, and became the
father of Michael Faraday.</p>

<p>Robert and Elizabeth Faraday's six sons were each
of them brought up to some trade or craft, and were
thus all of them fitted to go out into the world and
fight the battle of life. One son became a grocer and
(as his grandfather, "Richard ffaraday," had been)
tiler; one a farmer; one a shoemaker, and so on. The
third son, James, to us the most interesting member of
this large family, although he appears to have been of
somewhat weak constitution and unfitted for so laborious
a vocation, became a blacksmith, served his apprenticeship,
and exercised his craft for some time in the
neighbourhood of his birthplace. When he was five-and-twenty
years old (in 1786), James married; his
wife being Margaret Hastwell, the daughter of a farmer
living near Kirkby Stephen, a place some few miles away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
from Clapham, over the Westmoreland border. For two
years or thereabouts did the young blacksmith and his
wife remain in the neighbourhood of Clapham; but after
that time had elapsed they determined to come up to
London, and seek their fortunes in the great metropolis.
To the young men and women of our rural places the
very name of London has about it, even to-day, a ring
as of genuine coin, that tempts them to leave in large
numbers the homes of their childhood that they may
plunge into the vortex of city life. A hundred years
ago this strange attractive power of the metropolis was
probably much greater, owing to the difficulty of reaching
it and the vague stories that were told of its wealth. They
who had "been to London" were looked upon in rural
places as veritable travellers, and were to their "home-keeping"
friends objects of greater curiosity than anyone
who to-day returns from the farthest or wildest portion of
the earth's surface. The old story of "the London streets
being paved with gold"&mdash;the story that had buoyed up
the spirits of the youthful Whittington&mdash;seems yet
in the last century to have gained some credence.
Whether they were induced to do so by promises of
work, or merely attracted to London as a centre where
work would probably be plentiful, we cannot say; but it
is at any rate certain that the Faradays removed from
the Yorkshire village to a London suburb some time
before the autumn of 1791. For it was on the 22nd of
September in that year that there was born to them at
Newington Butts their third child, Michael, the future
illustrious chemist and philosopher, upon the story of
whose life we are now about to enter.</p>

<p>Of Michael's early years we have but a very meagre
account. When he was about five years old his family
removed from Newington Butts, and went to live in
Jacob's Well Mews, Charles Street, Manchester Square,
where they occupied rooms over a coach-house. James
Faraday found employment at this time in Welbeck
Street, while his young son passed his time, as children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
so circumstanced generally do, in playing in the streets;
in after years, indeed, that son, become a prominent
man, would point out where in Spanish Place he
used to play at marbles, and where in Manchester Square
he had at a later time been proud of having to take care
of his younger sister, Margaret. It was from Jacob's
Well Mews, too, that Michael went to school, and
received such scant education as was to be his before it
became necessary that he, as a youth of thirteen, should
step into the ranks of the workers and begin the battle
of life in earnest; such education as he received was of
the "most ordinary description (to use his own words),
consisting of little more than the rudiments of reading,
writing, and arithmetic at a common day-school. My
hours out of school were passed at home and in the
streets."</p>

<p>When Faraday was a boy nine years of age, in the
first year of the present century, there was a time of
much distress, when the rate of wages was very low, and
the price of food very high: corn, indeed, which is at
the present time about forty shillings per quarter, cost
then as much as £9 for the same quantity. The distress,
was felt very generally throughout the country, and the
Faraday family severely felt the hard times; Michael,
we are told, was allowed one loaf each week, and, it is
added (poor Michael!), that the loaf had to last him
that time.</p>

<div class="caption">THE HOUSE IN JACOB'S WELL MEWS.</div>
</div>

<p>Near by where the Faraday family lived in Jacob's
Well Mews there was, at No. 2, Blandford Street, a
worthy bookseller named Riebau. In 1804, when
Faraday was a boy of thirteen, he was employed as an
errand boy by Mr. Riebau, "for one year on trial"&mdash;a
trial that, as we shall shortly see, proved highly satisfactory.
Michael's duty as errand boy, when he commenced,
was to carry round the newspapers which were
lent out by his master. He would get up very early each
Sunday morning, and take the papers round, so that
he might be able to call again for them while it was yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>fairly early; frequently he would be told that he "must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>call again," as the paper was not done with. On such
occasions he would beg to be allowed to have it at once,
as the next place at which he had to call might be a
mile off, and he would lose so much time going twice
over his rounds that he would not be able to get home
and make himself neat, so that he might go with his
parents to their place of worship. Mr. Riebau's shop,
it may be noted, has changed but little since the early
part of this century, it is still a stationer's business, and
on the front of the house is placed a plaque bearing the
simple inscription "Michael Faraday, Man of Science,"
with the date of his apprenticeship there. This plaque
has furnished the simple yet sufficient title for this
volume.</p>

<p>His father, it may here be noted, had joined the
Sandemanian Church, or the followers of Robert
Sandeman, who, with his father-in-law, the Reverend
John Glas, had seceded from the Scotch Presbyterian
Church, and with him had started the sect which
was named after Sandeman, or, as they are still called
in Scotland, Glasites. In joining the Sandemanian
Church, James Faraday was following the family tradition,
for the large family of Clapham Faradays, to whom
we have referred, were all members of the same body.
Michael's mother, although she had not formally become
a member of the Church, used regularly to attend as
one of the congregation. Michael, as we shall learn,
joined the Church later on, and continued a devout and
sincere member of it up to the time of his death.</p>

<p>For about a year did young Faraday continue as Mr.
Riebau's errand boy; for about a year, as Professor
Tyndall puts it, "he slid along the London pavements,
a bright-eyed errand boy, with a load of brown curls
upon his head and a packet of newspapers under his
arm." We learn from one of his nieces that in his later
years he rarely saw a newsboy without making some
kind remark about him; as he said on one such occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"I always feel a tenderness for those boys, because I
once carried newspapers myself." He was reproached,
he says, as a boy, with being a great questioner. "He
that questioneth much," says Lord Bacon, "shall learn
much;" but this truth is too often forgotten by their
elders when children are "inquisitive," and, as in
Faraday's case, what is but the natural questioning of
an awakening mind is put down to idle curiosity, and
the child is told (as we may often hear) "not to ask so
many questions."</p>

<p>Although Faraday says he was thus "charged with
being a great questioner," he could not recall what kind
of questions he put; though he tells one story against
himself which shows that all questioning, even that of a
young philosopher, is not necessarily wise. He had
called at a certain house to leave a newspaper, and
whilst waiting for the door to be opened he put his head
between the iron bars that separated the house from the
next, and while in that position asked himself, somewhat
strangely, which side of the railing he was on? No
sooner had he started the question than the door behind
him opened, he drew suddenly back, and, hitting himself
so as to make his nose bleed, he forgot all about his
question, which, without being answered, was yet it
would seem somewhat definitely settled.</p>

<p>When his year as errand boy expired, Michael
was apprenticed to Mr. Riebau to learn the trade of
bookbinder and stationer. His indentures are dated
October 7th, 1805, and contain in one line an excellent
testimonial to his character: "In consideration of his
faithful service no premium is given." Of the earlier
part of his seven years' apprenticeship we know but
little. His father wrote in 1809 to a brother at the old
home at Clapham, "Michael is bookbinder and stationer,
and is very active at learning his business. He has been
most part of four years of his time out of seven. He
has a very good master and mistress, and likes his place
well. He had a hard time for some while at first going;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
but, as the old saying goes, he has rather got the head
above water, as there are two boys under him."</p>

<div class="caption">"MICHAEL FARADAY, MAN OF SCIENCE, APPRENTICE HERE."</div>
</div>

<p>In that he was placed within reach of many and good
books, which should go a great way towards deciding his
scientific and speculative bent of mind, a position such
as that in Mr. Riebau's shop was as good a one as he
could have had. Not only were many scientific books,
that had hitherto been unavailable, now placed ready to
his hand, but he had in Riebau a kind and considerate
master; he was allowed, and it was a valuable privilege,
to be out occasionally of an evening that he might attend
the lectures on natural philosophy which a Mr. Tatum
was delivering at that time at his house in Dorset Street,
Fleet Street. Michael saw bills announcing the lectures
in shop windows, and became anxious to hear them,
which he was enabled to do owing to the kindness of his
master, Mr. Riebau, and the generosity of his elder
brother Robert, who at the time was following their
father's business, and made Michael a present on several
occasions of the shilling which was charged for entrance
to the lectures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1809 Faraday's family
removed from Jacob's Well Mews, where their home
had been for thirteen years, and went to live at 18,
Weymouth Street, near Portland Place, and there, on
October 30th of the following year, James Faraday died.
He had been out of health for some years, and seems
indeed to have been quite physically unfitted for so
laborious an occupation as that of blacksmith. In 1807
he had written to a brother at Clapham, "I am sorry to
say I have not had the pleasure of enjoying one day's
health for a long time. Although I am very seldom off
work for a whole day together, yet I am under the
necessity (through pain) of being from work part of
almost every day." He then concludes his letter in that
spirit of simple yet earnest devotion that appears to have
been characteristic of the whole family: "But we,
perhaps, ought to leave these matters to the overruling
hand of Him who has a sovereign right to do what
seemeth good to Him, both in the armies of heaven and
amongst the inhabitants of the earth."</p>

<p>Michael's strong affection for his parents became, as
he grew older, one of the most marked features of his
character; his great love for his mother is shown in
many ways, notably in every letter which he wrote to
her. The following story illustrates, as do many others
that are told of him, Faraday's depth of feeling with
regard to his family. After he had become recognised
by the world as the great man that he was, and when
sitting to Noble for his bust, it happened that the
sculptor, in giving the finishing touches to the marble,
made a clattering with his chisels: noticing that his
sitter appeared moved, he said he feared the jingling of
the tools had distressed him, and that he was weary.
"No, my dear Mr. Noble," said Faraday, putting his
hand upon his shoulder, "but the noise reminded me of
my father's anvil, and took me back to my boyhood."</p>

<p>Gradually Faraday's interest widened in those matters
which later on were to entirely engross his attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
His apprenticeship at first gave him many opportunities
of reading philosophical and scientific works. "I
loved," he afterwards wrote, referring to this time, "to
read the scientific books which were under my hands,
and, amongst them, delighted in Marcet's <cite>Conversations
in Chemistry</cite>, and the electrical treatise in the <cite>Encyclopædia
Britannica</cite>. I made," he adds, and the item is
interesting as giving us a first glimpse at his experiments,
"I made such simple experiments in chemistry
as could be defrayed in their expense by a few pence
per week, and also constructed an electrical machine,
first with a glass phial, and afterwards with a real
cylinder, as well as other electrical apparatus of a
corresponding kind." Watts' <cite>On the Mind</cite>, was, he
said, the first thing that made him really think; while
his thoughts were directed towards science by an article
on electricity, which he lighted upon in an encyclopædia
entrusted to him to bind. Such glimpses into the early
reading&mdash;showing us how the bent of his genius is decided&mdash;are
always interesting in the life of one who, as
Tennyson says, "Has made by force his merit known."</p>

<p>Into Faraday's early reading&mdash;or that part of his
reading which bore upon the science with which his
name is so intimately connected&mdash;we have indeed something
more than a glimpse, for he compiled (during
1809-10) a note book in which he wrote down the
names of such books and articles connected with the
sciences as interested him. This note book he called,
"<cite>The Philosophical Miscellany</cite>: being a collection of
notices, occurrences, events, etc., relating to the arts and
sciences, collected from the public papers, reviews,
magazines, and other miscellaneous works; intended
to promote both amusement and instruction, and also to
corroborate or invalidate those theories which are continually
starting into the world of science."</p>

<p>Thus ambitiously did Michael Faraday, a youth of
not yet twenty years, start upon his career as an investigator;
thus early did he evince a desire to "corroborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
or invalidate those theories which are continually starting
into the world of science." Among books and articles to
which reference is made in the interesting <cite>Miscellany</cite>, there
are papers by Dr. Darwin,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> papers on a "Description of a
Pyro-pneumatic Apparatus," and "Experiment on the
Ocular Spectra of Light and Colours," frequent references
to "lightning," "electric fish," and other electrical
phenomena, showing his early leaning towards this particular
branch of investigation. There is a reference to
the short essay on the <cite>Formation of Snow</cite>, which forms
the reading for December 5th, in that interesting, and
at the present time neglected, work, Sturm's <cite>Reflections
on the Works of God</cite>. This book has perhaps been
supplanted in a great measure by the many popular
treatises on science and natural history which recent
years have produced, but which, nevertheless, have not
taken the place of the <cite>Reflections</cite>, the simplicity and
directness of which give to the volume a perennial charm
such as but few books can maintain. Other papers, such
as that on "How to Loosen Glass Stopples," included
in the <cite>Miscellany</cite>, show us Faraday's interest in the
science of everyday life, to which in his later years we
owe those delightfully interesting lectures on "The
Chemical History of a Candle," lectures to which fuller
reference is made later on in this volume. One other
reference in the <cite>Miscellany</cite> is at any rate worthy of
passing note for obvious reasons, or for reasons which
are obvious as soon as we learn how closely connected is
the career of Faraday with that of his great benefactor
and predecessor in the field of research, Sir Humphry
Davy. The reference is from the <cite>Chemical Observer</cite>, to
the effect that "Mr. Davy (he was knighted in 1812)
has announced to the Royal Society a great discovery in
chemistry&mdash;the fixed alkalies have been decomposed by
the galvanic battery."</p>

<p>From the lectures at Mr. Tatum's house our young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>philosopher gained something more than a knowledge of
the subjects discussed&mdash;he gained several friends, intercourse
and exchange of ideas with whom were to form
no inconsiderable part of his education; that he might
illustrate the lectures, too, he set to study perspective,
being kindly assisted in his work by Mr. Masquarier, a
French refugee artist who was lodging at the time at
Mr. Riebau's, and whose kindness to him Faraday never
in after years forgot to acknowledge. About a dozen
lectures at Mr. Tatum's were spread over rather more
than eighteen months (February, 1810&mdash;September,
1811). At them, Faraday became acquainted with
Benjamin Abbott, a confidential clerk in the City&mdash;an
acquaintance that ripened into life-long friendship;
here also he met Huxtable, a medical student, to whom
he addressed the earliest note of his which is extant.
Other kindred spirits with whom Faraday entered into
friendly relations at the Dorset Street lectures, were
Magrath, Newton, Nichol, and many more. There is
a perverted and ridiculous story told of Faraday's first
hearing Davy lecture, to the effect that "Magrath happening,
many years ago, to enter the shop of Mr. Riebau,
observed one of the bucks of the paper bonnet zealously
studying a book which he ought to have been binding.
He approached; it was a volume of the old <cite>Britannica</cite>,
open at 'Electricity.' He entered into talk with the
journeyman, and was astonished to find in him a self-taught
chemist, of no slender pretensions. He presented
him with a set of tickets for Davy's lectures at
the Royal Institution; and daily thereafter might the
nondescript be seen perched, pen in hand, and his eyes
starting out of his head, just over the clock opposite
the chair. At last the course terminated; but Faraday's
spirit had received a new impulse, which nothing but
dire necessity could have restrained." This circumstantial
yet exaggerated story, couched as it is in the
worst of tastes, is yet quoted with approval in a recent
work supposed of some authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Magrath, as we have seen, Faraday had met earlier,
and, as he tells us himself, the kindness of giving him
tickets for Davy's lectures was done him by Mr. Dance.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The story quoted above says also that he might be
seen <em>daily</em>, and that "at last" the course terminated.
To show us how garbled is this account and in what
it is true, we will turn to an account of this incident&mdash;this
important incident&mdash;in his life, which Faraday
himself wrote out later at the request of a correspondent.
"During my apprenticeship," he says, "I had
the good fortune, through the kindness of Mr. Dance,
who was a customer of my master's shop, and also a
member of the Royal Institution, to hear four of the
last lectures of Sir H. Davy in that locality. The
dates of these lectures were February 29th, March 14th,
April 8th and 10th, 1812. Of these I made notes, and
then wrote out the lectures in a fuller form, interspersing
them with such drawings as I could make.
The desire to be engaged in scientific occupation, even
though of the lowest kind, induced me, whilst an
apprentice, to write, in my ignorance of the world and
simplicity of my mind, to Sir Joseph Banks, then
President of the Royal Society. Naturally enough,
'no answer' was the reply left with the porter."</p>

<p>The four lectures which Faraday heard during the
spring of 1812 were, as we shall see in the next chapter,
to mark an epoch in his life. At each of these lectures,
we are told, the delighted youth listened to Sir
Humphry Davy, from a seat in the gallery immediately
over the clock directly facing the illustrious lecturer;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
both speaker and listener being unaware of the close
inter-connection there was destined to be between their
two careers. But of this in the next chapter, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>between Faraday's hearing Davy's lectures and his correspondence
with that great man, there are one or two
other interesting facts in connection with the life of our
bookbinder's apprentice and would-be philosopher. In
July of this year it was that Michael commenced his
long and interesting series of letters to Benjamin Abbott,
letters that show us how keenly alive Faraday was to
all things connected with the work with which he was
anxious to become more intimately connected, and at
the same time how anxious he was to make up for his
deficiencies of education.</p>

<p>In all his letters we find a charm in the simple
earnestness of the man, in his straightforward search
for truth, in the unreserved openness which characterised
him when corresponding with one whom he not
only called a friend, but treated as such on all occasions.
Simplicity, in its best and highest meaning, was,
if we can in one word sum up the character of a man,
the chief feature of Faraday in all his relations
throughout life. Through all his letters to his intimate
friends, too, there runs a vein of unaffected pleasantry
which shows us at once that he was no "mere scientist,"
no "dry-as-dust" philosopher, which is a character too
often given by thoughtless and careless persons to men
who earn their laurels in any special field of research.
We find that the great chemist or philosopher is not
only a great scientist, but that he is also, as Faraday undoubtedly
was, a man of a simple, earnest, reverent
nature, a man whose married life was one series
of years of love-making, who was a cheerful, pleasant
friend and companion, and intense and earnest lover
of children.</p>

<p>Perhaps I cannot better conclude this chapter than
by giving a few passages from his early letters, passages
that will fully bear out much of what is said in the
preceding paragraph. It was in July, 1812, three
months before the articles of his apprenticeship ran
out, that Faraday began his letters to Abbott; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
not as yet twenty-one years of age, his early education,
as we have seen, had been chiefly the three R's, yet we find
these letters eminently remarkable for their correctness
and fluency, not less than for their kindness, courtesy,
and candour. His first letter to Abbott is, indeed,
doubly interesting, for it gives us the earliest account we
have of any of his experiments. After writing a good
deal on what he considers to be the advantage of a
correspondence, he continues: "I have lately made a
few simple galvanic experiments, merely to illustrate
to myself the first principles of the science.... I,
sir, I my own self, cut out seven discs of the size of
halfpennies each! I, sir, covered them with seven halfpence,
and I interposed between seven, or rather six,
pieces of paper soaked in a solution of muriate of
soda!!! But laugh no longer, dear A.; rather wonder
at the effects this trivial power produced. It was sufficient
to produce the decomposition of sulphate of
magnesia&mdash;an effect which extremely surprised me;
for I did not, could not, have any idea that the agent
was competent to the purpose."</p>

<p>Again, to the same friend, he writes: "What?
affirm you have little to say, and yet a philosopher?
What a contradiction! What a paradox! 'tis a circumstance
I till now had no idea of, nor shall I at any
time allow you to advance it as a plea for not writing.
A philosopher cannot fail to abound in subjects, and a
philosopher can scarcely fail to have a plentiful flow of
words, ideas, opinions, etc., etc., when engaged on them;
at least, I never had reason to suppose you deficient
there. Query by Abbott: 'Then pray, Mike, why have
you not answered my last before now since subjects are
so plentiful?' 'Tis neither more nor less, dear A., than
a want of time. Time, sir, is all I require, and for
time will I cry out most heartily. Oh that I could
purchase at a cheap rate some of our modern gents'
spare hours, nay, days; I think it would be a good
bargain both for them and me. As for subjects, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is no want of them. I could converse with you, I will
not say for ever, but for any finite length of time.
Philosophy would furnish us with matter; and even
now, though I have said <em>nothing</em>, yet the best part of
a page is covered."</p>

<p>A little later he writes, acknowledging a letter from
his friend, a letter which found him paper-hanging&mdash;"but
what a change of thought it occasioned; what a
concussion, confusion, conglomeration; what a revolution
of ideas it produced&mdash;oh! 'twas too much; away
went cloths, shears, paper, paste, and brush, all&mdash;all
was too little, all was too light to keep my thoughts
from soaring high, connected close with thine."</p>

<p>This letter, after referring to his friend's electrical
experiments, he finishes somewhat sadly, "You know I
shall shortly enter on the life of a journeyman, and
then I suppose time will be more scarce than it is even
now." Little did he dream how great a change in his
prospects one short half year would make.</p>

<div class="verse indent10"><span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is a story told of Sir Humphry Davy, that,
on being asked on a certain occasion to enumerate
what he considered as his greatest discoveries, he named
first one thing and then another,&mdash;now his wonderful
safety-lamp, then some electrical discovery, finishing
up with "but the greatest of all my discoveries was the
discovery of Michael Faraday."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1812, as we have seen, Faraday
was a bookbinder, whose apprenticeship was just at an
end, and who was contemplating, as the only thing
possible, the taking up of life as a journeyman at the
craft at which for seven years he had been working;
indeed, a journeyman bookbinder he became, for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
October of that year he engaged himself to a Mr. De
la Roche, who, though a quick-tempered, passionate
man, seems to have really cared for Faraday, so much
so, indeed, that he said to him, "I have no child, and
if you will stay with me you shall have all I have
when I am gone." But Michael was not thus to be
tempted from the path which he desired to tread, as
he wrote afterwards to Davy's biographer, "My desire
to escape from trade, which I thought vicious and
selfish, and to enter into the service of science, which I
imagined made its pursuers amiable and liberal, induced
me at last to take the bold and simple step of writing to
Sir H. Davy, expressing my wishes and a hope that if
an opportunity came in his way he would favour my
views; at the same time, I sent the notes I had taken
of his lectures."</p>

<p>Shortly after Sir Humphry received Faraday's
application, speaking to a friend&mdash;the honorary inspector
of the models and apparatus&mdash;he said, "Pepys,
what am I to do? Here is a letter from a young man
named Faraday; he has been attending my lectures,
and wants me to give him employment at the Royal
Institution. <em>What can I do?</em>"</p>

<p>"Do?" was Pepys' reply, "do? put him to wash
bottles; if he is good for anything, he will do it
directly; if he refuses, he is good for nothing."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Davy, "we must try him with
something better than that."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that his similar application
of some months before to Sir Joseph Banks had met
with no answer, Faraday, in his desire to leave trade
for science, had thus addressed another of the leading
men of the day. Davy's reply was "immediate, kind,
and favourable." It was this&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="marginright">"<em>December 12th, 1812.</em></p>

<p>"To Mr. Faraday,</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I am far from displeased with the proof you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>have given me of your confidence, and which displays
great zeal, power of memory, and attention. I am
obliged to go out of town, and shall not be settled in
town till the end of January; I will then see you at
any time you wish. It would gratify me to be of any
service to you; I wish it may be in my power.</p>

<p class='center'>"I am, Sir, your obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="marginright">"<span class="smcap">H. Davy.</span>"<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="600" height="607" alt="SIR HUMPHRY DAVY" />
<div class="caption">SIR HUMPHRY DAVY.</div>
</div>

<p>The young bookbinder's delight on receiving the great
and kindly-natured man's note may easily be imagined,
as also may his anxiety for Davy's return. Five weeks,
however, are soon passed, and Michael duly met Sir
Humphry "by the window which is nearest to the
corridor, in the ante-room to the theatre" at the Royal
Institution. Davy was much impressed by the sincerity
and modesty of the applicant, but yet advised him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
continue at his bookbinding, going so far, indeed, as to say
that he would get the Royal Institution binding for him,
and would recommend him to his friends.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> With this,
for the present, Faraday had to be content. He returned
to his binding, delighted that he had met and
conversed with the greatest chemist of his time, but
still anxious for an opportunity to leave that trade to
which, as he had said, he was so averse, and to become
wholly the servant of that science to which he was so
attached.</p>

<p>The change in his vocation was to come far more
rapidly than he could have anticipated. He was still
living, at this time (early in 1813), at 18, Weymouth
Street, and one night, not very long after his interview
with Davy, just as he was undressing to go to bed, there
came a loud knock at the front door. Michael went to
the window to see if there was any evidence as to
whom the unwonted visitor might be. A carriage was
there, from which a footman had alighted and left a
note for "Mr. M. Faraday." It proved to be from
Sir Humphry, who had already an opportunity of
serving the young enthusiast. The note requested
Michael to call on Davy the next morning. This he
did, and learned that an assistant in the laboratory of
the Royal Institution was required at once, the former
assistant having been dismissed the day before.
Michael instantly expressed his willingness to accept
the position; he was to have twenty-five shillings a
week salary, and two rooms at the top of the Institution
building.</p>

<p>It was not long before arrangements were all completed.
A meeting of the managers of the Institution
was held on March 1st; the following is entered in
the minutes of that day's proceedings:&mdash;"Sir Humphry
Davy has the honour to inform the managers that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>has found a person who is desirous to occupy the
situation in the Institution lately filled by William
Payne. His name is Michael Faraday. He is a youth
of twenty-two years of age. As far as Sir H. Davy
has been able to observe or ascertain, he appears well
fitted for the situation. His habits seem good, his
disposition active and cheerful, and his manner intelligent.
He is willing to engage himself on the same
terms as those given to Mr. Payne at the time of
quitting the Institution. <em>Resolved</em>:&mdash;That Michael
Faraday be engaged to fill the situation lately occupied
by Mr. Payne on the same terms."</p>

<p>The duties of the assistant were specified by the
managers in the following manner, his work being
something other than the washing of bottles, which
Pepys had recommended. It is a fact, also, that
Faraday, almost from the commencement of his engagement,
was concerned in more important work than
that herein particularised. He was "to attend and
assist the lecturers and professors in preparing for, and
during, lectures; when any instruments or apparatus
may be required, to attend to their careful removal
from the model room or laboratory to the lecture-room,
and to clean and replace them after being used,
reporting to the manager such accidents as shall require
repair, a constant diary being kept by him for that
purpose. That, in one day in each week, he be employed
in keeping clean the models in the repository,
and that all the instruments in the glass cases be
cleaned and dusted at least once within a month."
As has been said, Faraday's work was almost from the
first of a higher nature; he is reported to have set
in order the mineralogical collection soon after his
arrival.</p>

<p>But a very short while elapsed between Michael's
appointment as assistant and his taking up the duties
of his post, for, on the 8th of March, he writes to
Abbott, dating his letter from his new home, the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
rooms at the top of the Institution. His letter tells us
that he was already concerned in the active duties
of his post, as the following passages show: "It is
now about nine o'clock, and the thought strikes me
that the tongues are going both at Tatum's and at the
lecture in Bedford Street; but I fancy myself much
better employed than I should have been at the lecture
at either of those places. Indeed, I have heard one
lecture already to-day, and had a finger in it (I can't
say a hand, for I did very little). It was by Mr.
Powell on mechanics, or rather, on rotatory motion,
and was a pretty good lecture, but not very fully
attended.</p>

<p>"As I know you will feel a pleasure in hearing in
what I have been or shall be occupied, I will inform
you that I have been employed to-day, in part, in extracting
the sugar from a portion of beetroot, and also
in making a compound of sulphur and carbon&mdash;a combination
which has lately occupied in a considerable
degree the attention of chemists."</p>

<p>About a month after writing the letter of which the
above forms a part, Faraday again wrote to his friend
Abbott, giving him an account of some experiments,
in which he had been assisting Sir Humphry Davy,
on "the detonating compound of chlorine and azote,
and of four different and strong explosions of the
substance, explosions from which neither he nor Davy
had altogether escaped unhurt." "Of these," he says,
"the most terrible was when I was holding between
my thumb and finger a small tube containing 7-1/2 grains
of the compound. My face was within twelve inches
of the tube; but I fortunately had on a glass mask.
It exploded by the slight heat of a small piece of
cement that touched the glass above half-an-inch from
the substance, and on the outside. The explosion was
so rapid as to blow my hand open, bear off a part of
one nail, and has made my fingers so sore that I cannot
yet use them easily. The pieces of the tube were projected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with such force as to cut the glass face of the
mask I had on." In the other three experiments also
they each of them got more or less cut about by the
explosion of the "terrible compound," as Faraday calls
it, Davy, indeed, in the last one, getting somewhat
seriously cut.</p>

<p>He writes thus frequently to Abbott during
the summer of 1813, giving him in the later letters
some well thought-out ideas on lectures and lecturing,
which we shall have occasion to glance at when we
are considering Faraday himself in the capacity of a
lecturer,&mdash;one of the most popular and yet truly
scientific lecturers of any time. In this year, his
twenty-first, Faraday joined the City Philosophical
Society, which had been founded about five years
earlier by Mr. Tatum, at whose house the meetings
were held. The Society consisted of some thirty or
forty individuals, "perhaps all in the humble or
moderate rank of life;" and certainly all of them
anxious to improve themselves and add to their knowledge
of scientific subjects. Once a week the members
gathered together for mutual instruction; each member
opening the discussion in his turn by reading a paper
of a literary or philosophical nature, any member failing
to do so at his proper time being fined half-a-guinea.
In addition, the members had what they modestly
called a "class book," but probably very like what we
should now call a manuscript magazine; in this each
member wrote essays, and the work was passed round
from one to another.</p>

<p>Michael, it will be seen, was not neglecting any
opportunity of educating himself; as he had said in
starting his correspondence with Abbott, one of his
objects was to improve himself in composition and to
acquire a clear and simple method of expressing that
which he had to say. Yet another method had he of
furthering his self-education. In the scanty notes
which he wrote about his own life he says, "During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
this spring (1813) Magrath and I established the
mutual improvement plan, and met at my rooms up
in the attics of the Royal Institution, or at Wood
Street at his warehouse. It consisted, perhaps, of
half-a-dozen persons, chiefly from the City Philosophical
Society, who met of an evening to read together, and
to criticise, correct, and improve each other's pronunciation
and construction of language. The discipline was
very sturdy, the remarks very plain and open, and the
results most valuable. This continued for several years."
It is a matter for wonder how Faraday, with all these
attempts to improve his language and method, and to
avoid even the slightest peculiarity, managed yet to
retain in all his work a remarkable simplicity and
naturalness of style.</p>

<p>On September 13, 1813, Faraday wrote to his uncle
and aunt, giving them an account of himself because
he had nothing else to say, and was asked by his
mother to write the account:&mdash;"I was formerly a
bookseller and binder, but am how turned philosopher,
which happened thus: Whilst an apprentice, I, for
amusement, learnt a little of chemistry and other parts
of philosophy, and felt an eager desire to proceed in
that way further. After being a journeyman for six
months, under a disagreeable master, I gave up my
business, and, by the interest of Sir Humphry Davy,
filled the situation of chemical-assistant to the Royal
Institution of Great Britain, in which office I now
remain, and where I am constantly engaged in observing
the works of nature and tracing the manner
in which she directs the arrangement and order of the
world. I have lately had proposals made to me by
Sir Humphry Davy to accompany him, in his travels
through Europe and into Asia, as philosophical assistant.
If I go at all, I expect it will be in October next,
about the end, and my absence from home will perhaps
be as long as three years. But, as yet, all is uncertain,
I have to repeat that, even though I may go, my path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
will not pass near any of my relations, or permit me
to see those whom I so much long to see."</p>

<p>This Continental trip with Davy forms one of the
chief episodes in Faraday's life. He had, though two-and-twenty
years of age, never before been further
than a few miles out of London. The country
through which he passed, the sea, and the mountains,
all came to him as a revelation. The letters which he
wrote home from abroad, and the journals which he
kept, all express his wonder at the strange sights, and
all breathe the kindliness of nature and affection for
home and those at home which all his life long were
strongly marked characteristics. His letters to his
mother are especially pleasing. He was away for but
little over eighteen months, yet an account of his
travels merits a chapter to itself. The commencement
of 1813 marked an epoch in his life, the close
of the same year marked another.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, October 13th, 1813.&mdash;This morning
formed an epoch in my life."</p>

<p>Thus commences the first entry in that journal, in
which, all the while that he was away, Faraday noted
down particulars of what he saw and thought. And,
indeed, the young traveller's remark is by no means an
exaggeration, as we recognise when we consider that he
had never been out of sight of the metropolis, that he
was accompanying one of the leading chemists, and that
he and Davy, Englishmen both, were allowed free passports
through France, although this and that country
were at the time at war with one another. The fact
that Davy was a scientist overshadowed the fact that
he was an Englishman in the eyes of the French
authorities; as the former, he was permitted to travel
anywhere, and to use libraries, museums, etc., at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
time; as the latter, he would have been instantly taken
prisoner. This was an early and pleasing recognition
of the universality of science, of its more than political
or national interest, nay, of its international importance.</p>

<p>So minute are the descriptions of things seen, so
clear and simple is the language employed, that
Faraday's journal is most delightful reading; while
the letters written home and to his friends are no less
pleasing; perhaps, indeed, they are more so as they are so
eminently characteristic of the man. They are remarkable
for the unaffected spirit of affection which breathes
through them, and show us, as indeed was shown in all
ways throughout his life, the keen sensitiveness of his
feelings and the genuine earnestness with which he was
at all times seeking for self-improvement.</p>

<p>On reaching Plymouth, Faraday gives expression in
his diary to the wonder which moved him at seeing the
country for the first time. The journey, of course, had
to be done by road, as it was long before the time of
railways; but coach or carriage riding, during fine
autumn weather, through some of the most delightful
scenery of rural England, must at any time be preferable
to, though less expeditious than, railway travelling;
and that Michael felt the full benefit of it is shown
by the following passage from the journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Friday, October 15th.</em>&mdash;Reached Plymouth this afternoon.
I was more taken by the scenery to-day than by
anything else I have ever seen. It came upon me unexpectedly,
and caused a kind of revolution in my ideas
respecting the nature of the earth's surface. That such
a revolution was necessary is, I confess, not much to my
credit; and yet I can assign to myself a very satisfactory
reason, in the habit of ideas induced by an acquaintance
with no other green surface than that within three miles
of London. Devonshire, however, presented scenery very
different to this; the mountainous nature of the country
continually put forward new forms and objects, and the
landscape changed before the eye more rapidly than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
organ could observe it. This day gave me some idea of
the pleasures of travelling, and has raised my expectations
of future enjoyment to a very high point."</p>

<p>If the surface of the earth gave our amateur traveller
cause for wonder, what must have been his feelings
when he first went down to the sea-shore? or when, on
the night of October 17th, he was on board in mid-channel,
with the "immense waves," as he graphically
puts it, "striding one after another at a considerable
distance?" or when, again, to use his own words, the
vessel "sank down into the valleys between the great
waves, and we had nothing in view but the wall of
waters around us." He carefully observed, on this
occasion, remaining on deck all night for that purpose,
the phosphorescence of the sea. The next day they
reached the harbour of Morlaix, on the French coast,
where, after much examination of luggage, and searching
in all possible and impossible places for contraband
goods by the French Customs' officers, they took up
their lodging for a couple of nights. And on the 22nd,
the carriage having been successfully put together (to
ensure comfortable accommodation Sir Humphry had
brought his own with him), the party commenced their
tour, reaching Paris, where a stay of three months'
length was made, on the 29th. Faraday's observant
nature is made evident to us in every page of his
journal, and the light, humorous style in which much
of it&mdash;that part which admits of such treatment&mdash;is
written, gives evidence of the abiding cheerfulness of
his disposition.</p>

<p>On the road to Paris there was a temporary stoppage,
owing to the breaking of one of the horses' traces.
While the accident was being repaired by the postillion,
Faraday found, to his great delight, a glow-worm, the
first that he had seen, and which gave him much food
for reflection. So great an impression did the first sight
of the luminous little grub make on him, that, writing
to his mother six months afterwards, and enumerating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
some of the more important things he had seen in his
travels, he says, "I have seen a <span class="smcap">GLOW-WORM</span>!"</p>

<p>In Paris Davy stayed some three months, and
Faraday records the great disadvantage under which he
laboured through not knowing the French language.
Despite this, however, he attended lectures with Davy,
and accompanied him on visits to the laboratories of the
various French chemists of the day, among others to
that of Chevreul, who was even then (he was three
years older than Faraday) well known as one of the
rising chemists of the day.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It was well for Davy, and
his assistant too, perhaps, that the Paris authorities did
not read the entries which the young Englishman "with
a round chin, a brown beard, a large mouth, and a great
nose,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> made in his journal, for he records as follows a
visit which he paid to the Galerie Napoléon:&mdash;"It is,"
he wrote, "both the glory and the disgrace of France.
As being itself, and as containing specimens of those
things which proclaim the power of man, and which
point out the high degree of refinement to which he has
risen, it is unsurpassed, unequalled, and must call forth
the highest and most unqualified admiration; but when
memory brings to mind the manner in which the works
came here, and views them only as the gains of violence
and rapine, she blushes for the people that even now
glory in an act that made them a nation of thieves."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Although he thus discoursed in his journal about
what he saw and thought, he did not by any means
neglect his favourite science, and his journal during the
stay in Paris contains frequent reference to the experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>which Sir Humphry was carrying on with a new
substance which had been discovered a short while
before by a French chemist&mdash;M. Courtois. This substance,
now known as iodine, was the source of much
interesting research. Not only about the time of its
discovery, but during the whole of the century it has
afforded scope to chemists for much speculation and
useful experiment.</p>

<p>The race-prejudice, which early in the present century
affected English opinion of all things French, is to be
traced even in Faraday, who, with all his fairness and open-mindedness,
seems always congratulating himself on not
belonging to the people among whom he finds himself.
This insular spirit finds expression in such passages as
the following, which he wrote after staying indoors all
day with nothing better to do than to note the difference
between the rooms in Paris and those he was accustomed
to in England. He sums his views up thus:&mdash;"French
apartments are magnificent, English apartments are
comfortable; French apartments are highly ornamented,
English apartments are clean; French apartments are
to be seen, English apartments enjoyed; and the style
of each kind best suits the people of the respective
countries."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="300" height="210" alt="TORPEDO FISH" />
<div class="caption">TORPEDO FISH.</div>
</div>

<p>From Paris the small party&mdash;which consisted of Sir
Humphry and Lady Davy and Faraday, whose nominal
position was that of "assistant in chemistry and experiments"&mdash;went
south to Montpelier, near the coast of
the Mediterranean and some seventy-five miles from Marseilles.
After about six weeks' stay they again started
on their travels; and after a cold and adventurous
journey across the Alps, reached Turin on February 22nd,
at the close of the Carnival. From Turin they went to
Genoa&mdash;where Faraday was much interested in several
water-spouts which he saw in the bay&mdash;and then on to
Florence. Various experiments were made by Davy at
each place, on iodine, on the electricity of the torpedo
fish, etc.; while at each place Faraday found some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
opportunity of helping to satisfy his craving for
improvement. Of the stay at Florence the journal
gives but little account other than of Davy's experiment
to find out of what a diamond is composed,
and of the various
attempts which were
made with the assistance
of the "Duke's
burning glass" to burn
diamond. After noting
these experiments,
Faraday concludes:
"As yet it appears
that the diamond is
pure carbon."</p>

<p>From Rome, which was the next halting-place on
their travels, Michael wrote home to his mother a long
letter, every line of which breathes a spirit of true
affection. "I trust that you are well in health and
spirits, and that all things have gone right since I left
you.... Mr. Riebau and fifty other friends would
be inquired after, could I but have an answer. You
must consider this letter as a kind of general one,
addressed to that knot of friends who are twined round
my heart; and I trust that you will let them all know
that, though distant, I do not forget them, and that it is
not from want of regard that I do not write to each
singly, but from want of convenience and propriety;
indeed, it appears to me that there is more danger of
my being forgot than of my forgetting. The first and
last thing in my mind is England, home, and friends.
It is the point to which my thoughts still ultimately
tend, and the goal to which, looking over intermediate
things, my eyes are still directed. But, on the contrary,
in London you are all together, your circle being little
or nothing diminished by my absence; the small void
which was formed on my departure would soon be worn
out, and, pleased and happy with one another, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
seldom think of me. Such are sometimes my thoughts,
but such do not rest with me; an innate feeling tells
me that I shall not be forgot, and that I still possess
the hearts and love of my mother, my brother, my
sisters, and my friends.... Whenever a vacant hour
occurs I employ it by thinking on those at home. In
short, when sick, when cold, when tired, the thoughts
of those at home are a warm and refreshing balm to my
heart. Let those who think such thoughts useless, vain,
and paltry, think so still; I envy them not their more
refined and more estranged feelings: let them look
about the world, unencumbered by such ties and heartstrings,
and let them laugh at those who, guided more
by nature, cherish such feelings. For me, I still will
cherish them, in opposition to the dictates of modern
refinement, as the first and greatest sweetness in the life
of man."</p>

<p>It is in his letters such as this that we get to understand
Faraday, and to appreciate how it was that his
friends, members of his family, nay, even persons who
casually met him, were always struck by the simplicity
and lovableness of the man. Altogether, Michael got
much pleasure, and a great deal of experience, both of
life and of science, during his Continental tour, although
it was not a source of unmixed delight. His engagement
was to accompany Davy in the capacity of secretarial
and scientific assistant, but some work certainly not included
under that head fell to him owing to Sir Humphry's
valet not accompanying the party at the last moment.
Had he been with Davy alone this would have been of
little matter, for Davy was a kind and considerate man,
and would have dispensed with a servant's attendance,
and have recognised in Faraday the scientific assistant
only; but&mdash;unfortunately for Michael&mdash;Lady Davy, as
has been mentioned, accompanied her husband, and she
was not so considerate; and, in consequence, Faraday
was treated at times almost as a servant. This, occasionally,
was very trying to him; but Michael was too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of a philosopher to give in because circumstances were
not as he could wish, and he wrote to his friend Abbott,
that though he had to sacrifice much, "the glorious
opportunity he enjoyed of improving in the knowledge
of chemistry and the sciences continually determined
him to finish the voyage with Sir Humphry Davy." A
decision of this nature is characteristic of Faraday at all
times: he rarely started any work without having carefully
considered it; but, having started it, he was not
one to take his hand from the plough before the furrow
was completed.</p>

<p>This quality is well illustrated in a story which is told
of Faraday when he had become a well-known chemist.
He was arranging some apparatus with a scientific
instrument maker, when a small piece of glass fell to
the ground; Faraday made several unsuccessful efforts
to pick it up, when his companion said that it was
not worth troubling over. "Perhaps not," said Faraday;
"but I do not like to fail in accomplishing anything
that I have attempted."</p>

<p>The months of May and June were spent by the small
party mostly in Italy&mdash;first in Rome, then Naples, and
afterwards travelling from place to place. At Naples a
stay of some days was made, and Faraday's journal
gives us an interesting account of two visits to Mount
Vesuvius. On the second day the party, largely increased
by other visitors, had a picnic on the Mount. "Cloths
were laid on the smoking lava, and bread, chickens,
turkey, cheese, wine and water, and eggs roasted on the
mountain, brought forth, and a species of dinner taken
at this place. Torches were now lighted, and the whole
had a singular appearance; and the surrounding lazzaroni
assisted not a little in adding to the picturesque
effect of the scene. After having eaten and drunk, Old
England was toasted, and 'God save the king!' and
'Rule, Britannia' sung; and two very entertaining
Russian songs by a gentleman, a native of that country,
the music of which was peculiar and very touching."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="600" height="386" alt="NAPLES AND MOUNT VESUVIUS" />
<div class="caption">NAPLES AND MOUNT VESUVIUS.</div>
</div>

<p>From Naples the journey is continued up north
through all the magnificent scenery of Italy; the
journal giving us occasionally delightful word-pictures
of the landscape, and recording the young traveller's
observations on various natural phenomena. Now, as
we have seen, glowworms attract his attention, then
waterspouts, and the magnificent spectacle presented by
Vesuvius; and again his attention is occupied with the
beautiful fire-flies that appeared "in innumerable quantities;
at a distance they covered the side of the mountain,
and near us they passed over the fields, hovered on the
edge or crossed the road, often attaching themselves to
the harness, and emitting their bright and harmless
flashes of light in a rapid and beautiful manner."</p>

<p>In July our party found themselves settled in Geneva,
where some three months were passed very enjoyably in
congenial society. Davy was the guest of the elder De la
Rive, with whom he experimented in chemistry, and with
whom, they both being ardent sportsmen, he went out
fishing and shooting. "On these occasions," says
Professor Tyndall, "Faraday charged Davy's gun, while
De la Rive charged his own. Once the Genevese
philosopher found himself by the side of Faraday, and
in his frank and genial way entered into conversation
with the young man. It was evident that a person
possessing such a charm of manner and such high
intelligence could be no mere servant. On inquiry
De la Rive was somewhat shocked to find that the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant domestique</i> was really <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preparateur</i> in the laboratory
of the Royal Institution; and he immediately
proposed that Faraday thenceforth should join the
masters instead of the servants at their meals. To this
Davy, probably out of weak deference to his wife,
objected; but an arrangement was come to that Faraday
thenceforward should have his food in his own room."</p>

<p>For reasons such as these we can well understand
that Faraday's life during his Continental journeying
was not altogether as pleasant as he had anticipated it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>would be. In his letters his reserve on this matter
is marvellous, for it is only twice, and in writing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his intimate friend, Abbott, that he refers at all to
his, at times, uncomfortable situation, and then it
is to give point to what he has been saying in reply
to his friend's complaint as to the sordid and unintellectual
surroundings amid which he is compelled to live.
In his journals also Faraday's reticence with regard to
those with whom he travelled is noticeable; he wrote
impressions of what he saw, and of what he thought
that was worth record, and this was done merely for his
own future use and pleasure&mdash;he would never wish to
recall any petty humiliations which circumstances compelled
him to suffer, and they were very properly allowed
to pass unrecorded. Indeed, in the note quoted above,
particulars of which were given Professor Tyndall by
M. De la Rive, we learn more of the discomforts of his
post than Faraday himself ever allowed to escape. It is
indeed a great pity for his own good fame that Davy
should have allowed a "weak deference to his wife" to
influence him in such a matter, as it was a great pity
when a few years later he allowed a petty spirit of
jealousy to make him oppose the election of Faraday as
a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>From Geneva many letters were written home to his
mother and friends. This is characteristic: "Here,
dear mother, all goes well. I am in perfect health, and
almost contented, except with my ignorance, which
becomes more visible to me every day, though I endeavour
as much as possible to remedy it." It is strange
how different we find the Faraday of the letters and the
Faraday of the journal. In the first case the cheerful
kindliness, the affectionate, sympathetic side of the man's
nature at once strikes us; while in the journal the clear
and simple description, uncoloured by personal feeling or
prejudice, is no less remarkable.</p>

<p>The three months' stay at Geneva at an end, the small
party, bidding farewell to their hospitable and kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
host, De la Rive, turned south again. In De la Rive,
Michael, by his intelligence, his scientific enthusiasm,
and his unassuming cheerful disposition had won a life-long
friend. The route south may well be described
briefly in Michael's own words, from a letter to his
mother written early in November at Rome: "On
leaving Geneva we entered Switzerland, and traversed
that mountainous and extraordinary country with health
and fine weather, and were much diverted with the
curious dresses and customs of the country.... From
Switzerland we passed through the States of Baden, on
the Lake of Constance (they are very small), across an
arm of the kingdom of Wurtemburg, and into Bavaria.
In this route we had seen, though slightly, Lausanne,
Vevey, Zurich, Schaffhausen and the falls of the Rhine,
in Switzerland, and Munich, and many other towns in
Germany. On leaving Munich we proceeded to and
across the Tyrol, and got to Padua, and from Padua to
Venice. You will remember very well, I have no doubt,
the picture which hung in the parlour over the fireplace,
and which represented the Rialto and the Great Canal
of this town. The first I have had the pleasure of
crossing several times, and the second I have partly
traversed in a Venetian gondola.... After seeing Venice
for three days we left it, and came towards Italy, passing
Bologna and Florence."</p>

<p>Before reaching Florence the two philosophers went
out of their way to inquire into a phenomenon at Pietra
Mala which was much talked about. From certain
tracts of ground in the neighbourhood sheets of flame
of various sizes were said to burst out; the fire was said
to burn anything combustible, although the ground
where the flames were was not even heated; locally, it
was said to be the remains of an ancient volcano.
"Though it was raining hard, yet that would not deter
Sir Humphry from visiting those places; but, at the
same time, it made us wish to be as quick as possible.
Sir Humphry therefore went to the first place, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
went to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Acqua bollenti</i>, conducted by a man of the
village, who carried some fire, some straw, and some
water. I found the place in a cultivated field, not far
from a mountain, apparently of limestone. It was simply
a puddle perhaps formed by the present showers of rain.
Much gas rose from the earth, and passed through the
water, which made it appear boiling, and had given rise
to its name; but the water and the ground were quite
cold. I made another puddle with the water we
brought, near the one I found there, and I saw that the
gas rose up through it also; and it appeared to be
continually passing off from a surface of more than
eighteen inches in diameter. The soil appeared deep,
and close to the spot supported vegetation readily. The
man inflamed some straw, and then laid it on the
ground; immediately the gas inflamed, and the flame
spread to some distance from the straw over the surface
of the earth, waving about like the flame of weak spirits
of wine; this flame burnt some moments. On putting
a light to the bubbles which rose through the water
they inflamed, and sometimes a flame ran quickly from
them over the whole surface of the water. I filled a
bottle with the gas, but I could not distinguish any
smell in it. In pouring water into the bottle, and
lighting the jet of gas that came out, a large clear flame
was obtained. The whole of this flame was a very pale
blue, like spirits of wine. It inflamed paper and matches
readily, as might be expected; and when I held a dry
bottle or knife over it, they appeared to become dim by
condensing water: but this was uncertain, as the weather
was so rainy. The water had no taste, and appeared
pure rain water. I brought some of it and the gas
away, and returned to the village." In the "almost
deserted laboratory of the Florence Academy" experiments
with the Pietra Mala gas convinced Davy that it
was "light hydrocarburet, pure."</p>

<p>The second stay in Rome extended over nearly four
months, during which time the grand Carnival took place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Faraday had at this part of his tour a great deal of his
time to himself, and earnestly devoted himself to continuing
the study of the French and Italian languages,
on which indeed he had been working all the while he
had been away from home. But he also continued his
observations on men and manners, for during the Carnival
week he twice attended masked balls in a domino, besides
being present at the horse-races on the Corso, and at other
of the events of the Carnival. He was, however, anxious
to be on his way home to England, and his letters occasionally
show how sad he felt at not knowing how soon
the return would be.</p>

<p>It was, however, to be earlier than he anticipated.
On January 25th, 1815, he wrote to Abbott: "Now for
news! We shall part in a few weeks (pray write quickly)
for Naples, and from thence proceed immediately to
Sicily. Afterwards our road is doubtful; but this much
I know, that application is made for passports to travel
in the Turkish Empire, and to reside in Constantinople;
that it is Sir Humphry's intention to be among the Greek
islands in March, and at Athens early in the spring....
Adieu, dear friend. With you I have no ceremony.
The warmest wishes that friendship can dictate are formed
for you by M. Faraday." Thus had he written towards
the end of January&mdash;within three months he was to be
shaking hands with his friend at home!</p>

<p>While on the road to Naples, Faraday heard of the
escape of Napoleon from Elba on March 7th, and records
it thus briefly in his journal: "Tuesday, March 7th.&mdash;I
heard for news that Bonaparte was again at liberty.
Being no politician, I did not trouble myself about it,
though I suppose it will have a strong influence on the
affairs of Europe." It is strange how quietly Davy and
his "assistant" passed through Europe at a time when
war was convulsing nearly the whole of it; quietly and apparently
unconcernedly they went their way, seeing who
and what was to be seen at the various stopping-places,
prosecuting their researches in different branches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
chemistry, and adding in many ways to their stores of
knowledge, seemingly unaffected by</p>

<p class="center">"The time that tried men's souls."</p>

<p>At Naples Faraday again ascended Vesuvius, and on
this occasion had the grand experience of seeing it in
active eruption. He writes a full and graphic account
in the journal, from which one passage, descriptive of the
eruption itself, may well be quoted. This time Faraday
had ascended with a guide only, Sir Humphry having
stayed part way up the mountain to see Monte Somma.
"I saw a large shower of red-hot stones in the air,"
writes Faraday, "and felt the strong workings of the
mountain; but my care was now to get to the crater,
and that was soon done. Here the scene surpassed
everything. Before me was the crater, like a deep gulf,
appearing bottomless from the smoke that rose from
below. On the right hand this smoke ascended in
enormous wreaths, rolling above us into all forms; on
the left hand the crater was clear, except where the fire
burst out from the side with violence, its product rising
and increasing the volume of volatile matter already
raised in the air. The ground was in continual motion,
and the explosions were continual, but at times more
powerful shocks and noises occurred; then might be
seen rising high in the air numbers of red-hot stones and
pieces of lava, which at times came so near as to threaten
us with a blow. The appearance of the lava was at once
sufficient to satisfy one of its pasty form. It rose in the
air in lumps of various size, from 1/2 lb. to 25 lb. or more.
The form was irregular, but generally long, like splashes
of thick mud; a piece would often split into two or more
pieces in the air. They were red-hot, and, when they
fell down, continued glowing for five, ten, or fifteen
minutes.... I was there during one explosion of very
great force, when the ground shook as with a strong
earthquake, and the shower of lava and of stones
ascended to a very great height, and at this moment the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
smoke increased much in quantity. The guide now said
this place was not safe, from its exposed situation to the
melted lava and to the smoke, and because it oftentimes
happens that a portion of the edge of the crater is shaken
down into the gulf below. We therefore retreated a
little, and then sat down, listened, and looked."</p>

<p>We have seen from the letter to Abbott at the end of
January that a somewhat lengthened tour had been
planned out. On March the 21st Faraday's journal
says, "We left Naples at five o'clock." From that time
the return was rapid. At Rome there was some delay
owing to the lack of post-horses; the French troops
under Murat were advancing, and everybody was leaving
the city; the Pope had fled, and the cardinals were
flying. After a delay of a couple of days carriage-horses
were hired at a great expense, and the travellers proceeded
on their homeward flight. At Mantua delay
again occurred, as the passports had to be "signed, re-signed,
and countersigned." "At last," says Faraday,
"we saw the outside of the town, having, much against
our will, remained two hours and a-half in it."</p>

<p>Faraday's last letter home is written from Brussels on
April 16th; it is to his mother, and is well worth reading:
"My very dear Mother,&mdash;It is with no small
pleasure I write you my last letter from a foreign
country, and I hope it will be with as much pleasure
you will hear I am within three days of England. Nay
more, before you read this letter I hope to tread on
British ground.... I am not acquainted with the
reason of our sudden return; it is, however, sufficient
for me that it has taken place. We left Naples very
hastily, perhaps because of the motions of the Neapolitan
troops, and perhaps for private reasons. We came
rapidly to Rome, we as rapidly left it. We ran up Italy,
we crossed the Tyrol, we stepped over Germany, we
entered Holland, and we are now at Brussels, and talk
of leaving it to-morrow for Ostend; at Ostend we
embark, and at Deal we land on a spot of earth which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
will never leave again. You may be sure we shall not
creep from Deal to London, and I am sure I shall not
creep to 18, Weymouth Street; and then&mdash;but it is of
no use. I have a thousand times endeavoured to fancy
a meeting with you and my relations and friends, and I
am sure I have as often failed: the reality must be a
pleasure not to be imagined or described.... You
may be sure that my first moment will be in your company.
If you have opportunities, tell some of my dearest
friends, but do not tell everybody&mdash;that is, do not trouble
yourself to do it.... My thoughts wander from one
to another, my pen runs on by fits and starts; I do not
know what to say, and yet cannot put an end to my
letter. I would fain be talking to you, but must cease.
Adieu till I see you, dearest mother; and believe me
ever your affectionate and dutiful son,</p>

<p class="marginright">
"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday.</span>"</p>

<p>"'Tis the shortest and (to me) the sweetest letter I
ever wrote you."</p>

<p>Thus ended Faraday's wanderings&mdash;</p>

<p>He returned home better equipped for continuing the

<p>His friends and relations having had due attentions
from him, Faraday at once began to cast about
for work. On going abroad with Davy he had relinquished
his position at the Royal Institution, though
Sir Humphry had promised to befriend him on their
return; this promise was, much to Faraday's gratification,
duly fulfilled. Within a fortnight of his return
Michael found himself re-engaged at the Institution in
the capacity of "assistant in the laboratory and mineralogical
collection, and superintendent of the apparatus,"
a high-sounding office that carried with it the none too
substantial honorarium of thirty shillings a week, and,
as before, rooms in the building. It was, however, a
distinct rise, both in position and in wage, and Faraday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
we may be sure, was pleased to get back to his well-loved
Institution on such terms.</p>

<p>A life spent in scientific research is, generally, an
apparently uneventful one. Faraday's life, far from
being an exception to this rule, was rather an accentuation
of it. The story of his life is indeed highly
interesting; but its interest lies in it, not as a story of
action and change, but as a life that may be said to
have realised almost wholly the ideal which was set
before it. From the very first moment when Faraday
gave expression to his hate for trade and his love for
science, his whole life was a practical illustration of his
feelings; as we shall find on following him through
his great and honourable career, there were many
occasions on which he refused not only titles and such
like honours, but pecuniary benefits which might fairly
be considered his dues&mdash;no, "his work was wrought for
love and not for gain," as the line which I have placed
on the title page of this little book so well expresses it.</p>

<p>The tour on the Continent, as has been noted, was
the most striking episode in Faraday's long life. From
May 7th, 1815 (the date on which he rejoined the
Institution), onwards, his life was a time of steady
intellectual growth, spent in chemical research, in the
explaining of phenomena, and in what is by no means
his least claim on our regard, the popularisation of
scientific knowledge. We have seen in his early correspondence
with Benjamin Abbott how, on his very
earliest acquaintance with lecturing and lectures at the
Royal Institution, he began to study the different styles
of the various lecturers, to note their peculiarities, and
in what lay the secret of their success; we have seen,
too, how he was striving to improve himself in composition&mdash;in
the clear and intelligent method of stating
things. He was preparing himself betimes for what he
felt to be part of his true vocation; how eminently
successful&mdash;beyond his wildest imaginings&mdash;he was, will
be seen as we follow his life-story year by year.</p>

<div class="caption">THE DAVY SAFETY LAMP.</div>
</div>

<p>It was, as Faraday frequently acknowledged, his good
fortune to assist Sir Humphry Davy in his experiments
not only while abroad, but after their home-coming.
One of the most important of all Davy's discoveries was
made in the year of their return. On August 3rd he
acknowledged a letter which he had received from Dr.
Gray, directing his attention to the awful destruction of
human life by explosions in coal mines. On October
31st, Davy announced to his correspondent that he had
discovered a "safety lamp;" on November 2nd he read
a paper on fire-damp before the
Royal Society, and on December
14th submitted to Dr. Gray
models of lamps and lanterns
made on the principle of his
discovery, "that fire-damp will
not explode in tubes or feeders
of a certain small diameter." In
his experiments, in connection
with this discovery, Davy received
considerable help from his laboratory
assistant, who must have
been much gratified by that
passage in Davy's paper on the
"safety lamp," in which the
great discoverer expressed himself
as "indebted to Mr. Michael
Faraday for much able assistance." This was "Mr.
Michael Faraday's" first public recognition, and must
have been very delightful to him, especially coming as
it did from the man of all others for whom, in his
scientific capacity, Michael had the most profound
admiration.</p>

<p>Davy gained, as is well known, much honour and
no inconsiderable amount of money for his discovery.
There are, however, circumstances in which the safety
lamp is <em>not</em> safe; Faraday, and, it is to be presumed,
Davy himself, was aware of this. It is illustrative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Faraday's stern regard for truth that, although he was
at the time Davy's own assistant, he did not, and would
not, attest before a parliamentary committee to the
universal safety of the Davy lamp.</p>

<p>Early in 1816 we find Faraday beginning to put into
practice those ideas on lectures and lecturing which he
had so carefully considered before. On the point of
giving his first lecture, though, he seems to doubt himself,
and in a letter to Abbott occurs the following
passage&mdash;"I intend making some experiments on that
subject (lecturing) soon; I will defer it (his letter on
lecturing) till after such experiments are made. In
the meantime, as preparatory and introductory to such
a course of experiments, I will ask your opinion of,
and observations on, English composition&mdash;style, delivery,
reading, oratory, grammar, pronunciation, perspicuity,
and in general all the branches into which
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</i> divide themselves; and if by asking I
procure, I shall congratulate myself on the acquisition
of much useful knowledge and experience."</p>

<p>The first lecture&mdash;on the "General Properties of
Matter"&mdash;was duly and successfully delivered before
the City Philosophical Society on January 17th.
Before trusting himself to go upon the platform,
Faraday carefully wrote out his lecture, word for word,
as it was to be delivered; a plan which he followed
in the case of each of the other six lectures which he
gave before the same Society during the year. These
lectures I have had the pleasure of seeing, as they are
neatly written out and bound by their author. They
are, with many similar treasures, in the possession of
Miss Jane Barnard, a niece of Faraday.</p>

<p>This year was an important one in several ways;
not only did Faraday give his first lecture, but also his
first printed paper appeared in the <cite>Quarterly Journal
of Science</cite>, which was edited by Mr. Brande, who
succeeded Sir Humphry as chief of the Royal Institution.
The paper was on an analysis of native caustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
lime, which had been undertaken at Davy's instigation.
That his scientific friends and patrons were beginning
to recognise something out of the common in their
laboratory assistant is shown in various ways, notably
by such a passage as the following, taken from Faraday's
note-book: "When Mr. Brande left London in August,
he gave the <cite>Quarterly Journal</cite> in charge to me; it has
had very much of my time and care, and writing,
through it, has been more abundant with me. It has,
however, also been the means of giving me earlier
information on some new objects of science."</p>

<p>Faraday's common-place book&mdash;a kind of continuation
of his <cite>Philosophical Miscellany</cite> of six years earlier&mdash;gives
us a good deal of information as to his intellectual
progress at this time; it shows us not only
what scientific subjects were interesting him, but also
how zealously he was continuing his study of composition
and the mode of expressing what he had to say
clearly and definitely. There are passages from the
<cite>Spectator</cite>, alongside of tests with arsenic, a description
of a visit to a silk-ribbon dresser's, along with
an account of Zerah Colburn, the American calculating
boy. Sir Humphry Davy wrote to Faraday, saying,
"Mr. Colburn, the father of the American boy who
has such extraordinary powers of calculation, will
explain to you the method his son uses in confidence.
I wish to ascertain if it can be practically
used."</p>

<p>It has been remarked of Faraday that his was a
poet-nature expressing itself through science; and this
estimate seems largely true, but the verses which he
wrote in his common-place book, "On Love," if they
be his own composition, are extremely poor; there are
other verses though which will merit quotation. They
are written by Mr. Dryden, a fellow-member of the
City Philosophical Society, and are entitled "Quarterly
Night," October 2nd, 1816, being descriptive of one of
the periodical gatherings of the Society. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
passage is of especial interest to us, as it shows how
Faraday impressed a young contemporary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse indent2">I for the <em>principle</em> alone contend,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Would lash the crime, but make the man my friend.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Faraday's progress during these first few years after
his reinstatement at the Royal Institution was rapid:
his lectures to the City Philosophical Society, his published
papers, and his letters, all give evidence of it.
In 1817, as in the previous year, he delivered six lectures
before the Society. It is interesting to find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
instead of being written out word for word, the lectures
were now delivered from notes, showing how the young
lecturer was becoming so assured of his own command
of language as to make the earlier method no longer
necessary. His common-place book for this year continues
to show a wide range of reading and thoughtfulness. In
the summer, when the lectures at the Institution had
ceased for the recess, Faraday availed himself of an
invitation from his friend Huxtable, who was living at
South Moulton, and spent a month holiday-making in
Devonshire. His early impressions of that county,
when he passed through it with Davy on their way to
the Continent, must have made him especially delighted
to visit it once more; more particularly as he had an
opportunity on this occasion of making geological excursions
and of studying "wavellite, hydrargellite, and such
hard things." A letter which he wrote from Barnstaple
to his mother during this holiday is interesting,
referring as it does to those country occupations amid
which she, in her girlhood, passed her time:&mdash;"I have
seen a great deal of country life since I left town, and
am highly pleased with it, though I should by no means
be contented to live away from town. I have been at
sheep-shearings, merry-makings, junketings, etc., and was
never more merry; and I must say of the country
people (of Devonshire, at least) that they are the most
hospitable I could imagine. I have seen all your processes
of threshing, winnowing, cheese and butter-making,
and think I could now give <em>you</em> some instruction,
but all I have to say to you on these subjects shall
be said verbally."</p>

<p>Each year of his life at this period Faraday found
himself becoming busier than the previous one. Another
five chemical lectures (on the metals, well known and
little known) were given before the City Philosophical
Society during 1818, completing a course, extending
over three years, of seventeen lectures on the chemical
science, no mean accomplishment for a young man from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
twenty-three to twenty-six years of age. So much was
his time now becoming occupied that we find a great
falling-off in his letters this year, a falling-off not only
in number, but also in length. The correspondence with
Abbott, commenced six years earlier, practically comes
to an end in 1818; there was not, it is necessary to
mention, the slightest abatement in the warmth of affection
of the two friends; it was that, to a great extent,
perhaps, the correspondence had done its work, and what
is undoubtedly the more powerful reason, our young
scientist was beginning to find his time so well occupied
with his favourite work that he could not devote enough
of it to the writing of long letters. Abbott was yet, and
always, sure of the heartiest hand-shake and the most
unaffected welcome from one who to the end of his life
was the staunchest of friends.</p>

<p>On July 1st, 1818, Faraday read a highly interesting
paper before the members of the City Philosophical
Society, on "Observations on the Inertia of the Mind,"
in which he drew, in an able manner, an analogy
between a state of the mind and what in the physical
world is known as the inertia of matter. It may be of
interest to note a few passages from this lecture to illustrate
the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of Faraday's
work at this time, and also to give an example of his
early style as a lecturer.</p>

<p>"Unlike the animated world around him, which remains
in the same constant state, man is continually
varying, and it is one of the noblest prerogatives of his
nature, that in the highest of earthly distinctions he has
the power of raising and exalting himself continually.
The transition state of man has been held up to him
as a memento of his weakness; to man <em>degraded</em> it may
be so with justice; to man as he ought to be it is no
reproach; and in knowledge that man only is to be
contemned and despised who is <em>not</em> in a state of transition....</p>

<p>"By advancement on the plain of life, I mean advancement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in those things which distinguish men from
beasts&mdash;sentient advancement. It is not he who has
soared above his fellow-creatures in power, it is not he
who can command most readily the pampering couch or
the costly luxury; but it is he who has done most good
to his fellows, he who has directed them in the doubtful
moment, strengthened them in the weak moment, aided
them in the moment of necessity, and enlightened them
in their ignorance, that leads the ranks of mankind....</p>

<p>"There is a power in natural philosophy, of an influence
universal, and yet withal so obscure, in its nature
so unobtrusive, that for many ages no idea of it existed.
It is called <em>inertia</em>. It tends to retain every body in its
<em>present</em> state, and seems like the spirit of constancy impressed
upon matter. Whatever is in motion is by it
retained in motion, and whatever is at rest remains at
rest under its sway. It opposes every <em>new</em> influence,
strengthens every <em>old</em> one. Is there nothing in the
human mind which seems analogous to this power?...</p>

<p>"Inertia is an essential property of matter; is it a
never-failing attendant on the mind? I hope it is; for
as it seems to be in full force whenever the mind is
passive, I trust it is also in power when she is actively
engaged. Was the idle mind ever yet pleased to be placed
in activity? Was the dolt ever willing to resign inanity
for perception? Or are they not always found contented
to remain as if they were satisfied with their
situation? They are like the shepherd Magnus: although
on a barren rock, their efforts to remove are irksome and
unpleasant; and they seem chained to the spot by a
power over which they have no control, of which they
have no perception. Again: in activity, what intellectual
being would resign his employment? Who would
be content to forego the pleasures hourly crowding upon
him? Each new thought, perception, or judgment is a
sufficient reward in itself for his past labours, and all
the future is pure enjoyment. There is a labour in
thought, but none who have once engaged in it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
willingly resign it. Intermissions I speak not of; 'tis
the general habit and tenor of the mind that concerns
us, and that which has once been made to taste the
pleasures of its own voluntary exertions will not by a
slight cause be made to forego them.</p>

<p>"Inertia, as it regards matter, is a term sufficiently
well understood both in a state of rest and of motion.
As it is not my intention to attempt a description of
functions of the mind according to strict mathematical
terms, I shall resign the exclusive use of the word at
present, and adopt two others, which, according to the
sense they have acquired from usage, will, I believe,
supply its place with accuracy. Apathy will represent
the inertia of a passive mind; industry that of an active
mind.</p>

<p>"It is curious to consider how we qualify ideas essentially
the same, according to the words made use of to
represent them. I might talk of mental inertia for a
long time without attaching either blame or praise to it&mdash;without
the chance even of doing so; but mention
apathy and industry, and the mind simultaneously
censures the one and commends the other. Yet the
things are the same, both idleness and industry are
habits, and habits result from inertia....</p>

<p>"Inertia has a sway as absolute in natural philosophy
over moving bodies as over those at rest. It therefore
does not retard motion or change, but is as frequently
active in continuing that state as in opposing it. Now,
is this the case with mental inertia?"</p>

<p>These passages from Faraday's early lectures serve to
show us not only how he was attaining the art of
expressing himself clearly, but how thoroughly he went
into a subject on which he had once entered. It is not
possible to follow in detail the work on which Faraday
was engaged. We have seen him learning assiduously,
and essaying to teach in the friendly circle of the Philosophical
Society. His work during the next few years
continued on very similar lines to those which we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
been regarding. Year by year, about this time, his
scientific writing increased&mdash;his work was increasing, his
friends were increasing&mdash;he was beginning to be "somebody,"
though as yet but in a small world. He had
commenced a correspondence with Professor G. de la
Rive&mdash;the gentleman who at Geneva had been so
struck by him when he was acting as Davy's travelling
factotum&mdash;a correspondence which on the death of De la
Rive was continued with his son, Professor Auguste
de la Rive.</p>

<p>In 1821 Faraday married. Before, however, we treat
of this important step in his life, let us glance at
the journal which he kept of a walking tour he
took in Wales during the summer of 1819. This
journal gives us further evidence of the genuine enjoyment
which he found in scenery and nature in her
wilder and more impressive aspects; it also gives further
evidence of his simple yet direct way of describing
things, of that true descriptive power of which his Continental
journal was often a good illustration. At five
o'clock in the morning of July 10th, he mounted the
top of the <em>Regulator</em> coach at the White Horse Cellar,
Piccadilly, and at ten o'clock of the same evening was
set down at Bristol. Not at all a bad coach-ride for one
day's journey. He afterwards visited Cardiff, and went
over the Dowlais Ironworks at Merthyr; thence he
and his companion wandered about at their own sweet
will, unconfined by any artificial circumstances. They
walked in that manner which adds so great a charm to
a walking tour, never knowing one day whither they
should bend their way on the next. The following is a
delightful bit descriptive of a visit to the Fall of Scwd-yv-hên-rhyd,
or Glentaree, formed by the descent of the
River Hên-rhyd.</p>

<p>"<em>Monday, 19th.</em>&mdash;Proceeding onward into Brecknockshire,
we suddenly heard the roar of water where we
least expected it, and came on the edge of a deep and
woody dell. Entering among the trees, we scrambled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
onwards after our guide, tumbling and slipping, and
jumping, and swinging down the steep sides of the
dingle, sometimes in the path of a running torrent,
sometimes in the projecting fragments of slate, and
sometimes where no path or way at all was visible. The
thorns opposed our passage, the boughs dashed the drops
in our faces, and stones frequently slipped from beneath
our feet into the chasm below, in places where the view
fell uninterrupted by the perpendicular sides of the precipices.
By the time we had reached the bottom of the
dingle, our boots were completely soaked, and so slippery
that no reliance could be placed on steps taken in them.
We managed, however, very well, and were amply rewarded
by the beauty of the fall which now came in
view. Before us was a chasm enclosed by high perpendicular
and water-worn rocks of slate, from the sides of
which sprang a luxuriant vegetation of trees, bushes,
and plants. In its bosom was a basin of water, into
which fell from above a stream divided into minute
drops from the resistance of its deep fall. Here and
there lay trunks of trees which had been brought down
by the torrent&mdash;striking marks of its power&mdash;and the
rugged bed of shingles and rocky masses further
heightened the idea other objects were calculated to
give of the force it possessed when swelled by rains.
We stepped across the river on a few tottering and
slippery stones placed in its bed, and passing beneath
the overhanging masses ran round on projecting points,
until between the sheet of water and the rock over
which it descended; and there we remained some time
admiring the scene. Before us was the path of the
torrent, after the fine leap which it made in this place;
but the abundance of wood hid it ere it had proceeded
many yards from the place where it fell. No path was
discernible from hence, and we seemed to be enclosed on
a spot from whence there was no exit, and where no cry
for help could be heard because of the torrent-roar."</p>

<p>Yet another passage should be quoted from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
journal; a passage descriptive of an ascent of Cader
Idris during a thunder-storm. A thunder-storm was, all
his life long, one of the most moving things to Faraday.
It seemed always to quicken him into new life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="600" height="524" alt="CADER IDRIS" />
<div class="caption">CADER IDRIS.</div>
</div>

<p>"<em>Sunday, July 26th.</em>&mdash;Ascent of Cader Idris. The
thunder had gradually become more and more powerful,
and now rain descended. The storm had commenced at
the western extremity of the valley, and rising up Cader
Idris traversed it in its length, and then passing over
rapidly to the south-east, deluged the hills with rain.
The waters descended in torrents from the very tops of
the highest hills in places where they had never yet been
observed, and a river which ran behind the house into
the lake below rose momentarily, overflowing its banks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and extended many yards over the meadows. The storm
then took another direction, passing over our heads to
the spot in the west at which it had commenced, and
having been very violent in its course, seemed there to
be exhausted and to die away. The scene altogether was
a very magnificent one&mdash;the lightning's vivid flash illuminated
those parts which had been darkened by its
humid habitation, and the thunder's roar seemed the
agonies of the expiring clouds as they dissolved into
rain; whilst the mountains in echoes mocked the sounds,
and laughed at the fruitless efforts of the elements
against them."</p>

<p>The journeying was continued on to Dolgelly and
Llangollen; and then back again to London, and to
work on in his old indefatigable manner. Sir Humphry
Davy was in Italy in 1818-19, investigating the questions
with regard to the unrolling of papyri recovered
from the ruins of Herculaneum. In February, 1819,
he wrote to Faraday saying, "I have sent a report on
the state of the MSS. to our Government, with a plan
for the undertaking of unrolling; one part of the plan
is to employ a chemist for the purpose at Naples;
should they consent, I hope I shall have to make a
proposition to you on the subject." At the end of the
same year Davy again wrote to his protégé in a similar
strain, but nothing ever came of it. And delighted as
Faraday would doubtless have been to re-visit Italy, he
probably would not have undertaken the few months'
work at Naples if it had meant, as it would doubtless
have done, his severing his connection with the Royal
Institution.</p>

<p>A much more important step was about to be taken
by Faraday. He had a friend, also a member and elder
of the Sandemanian Church, by name Barnard. Mr.
Barnard was a silversmith who lived in Paternoster
Row, and thither Faraday often went, attracted by the
charms of Mr. Barnard's third daughter, Sarah. Faraday
was at this time twenty-nine years of age, the lady who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was to exercise so great an influence over his life was
but twenty, and what is more she did not favour his
advances. At last, in July, 1820, he wrote to her, and
in a letter characterised by the depth no less than the
warmth of his affection, begged at any rate to be heard.
Such letters, intended for the eyes of but one person,
are, as a rule, and it is well they should be, too sacred
to be freely reproduced for all the world to read. The
letters have, however, before been printed, and it may
assist us in forming a correct picture of Michael Faraday&mdash;of
the earnest, affectionate nature which was his&mdash;to
re-peruse a passage such as this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Again and again I attempt to say what I feel, but
I cannot. Let me, however, claim not to be that selfish
being that wishes to bend your affections for his own
sake only. In whatever way I can best minister to your
happiness, either by assiduity or by absence, it shall be
done. Do not injure me by withdrawing your friendship,
or punish me for aiming to be more than a friend
by making me less; and if you cannot grant me more,
leave me what I possess, but hear me."</p>

<p>Miss Barnard showed the letter from which this
passage is quoted to her father, whose reply was merely
to the effect that "love made philosophers into fools."
Doubtful of her own decision on so momentous a question
as this, involving the life-long happiness of two
persons, Miss Barnard postponed making an immediate
decision by accompanying a married sister to Ramsgate.
Faraday made up his mind "to run all risks of a kind
reception at Ramsgate." He went there, and after a
week of delightful holiday-making, returned to London
on August the 7th, having won the consent of her for
whom he had evinced so strong a passion. Within
twelve months (on June 12th, 1821), Michael Faraday
and Sarah Barnard were married, and took up their
residence in the Royal Institution. The union proved a
perfect one, and a wedded life of nearly half-a-century's
duration and of unclouded love was the result. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
this time forward the kindliness, the affection, the love
of home and of those persons forming "home," which
had been earlier so marked in Faraday's letters to his
mother, become even yet more marked in the letters
written to his wife any time between his marriage and
his death. Some of these we shall note as we come to
treat of the period in which they were written.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">

<div class="caption"><em>From a drawing by</em>] MRS. MICHAEL FARADAY. [<em>Alexander Blaikley</em>.</div>
</div>

<p>The year 1820 was an important one to Faraday for
other though less significant reasons: in it his first paper
was read before the Royal Society, and he was also engaged
with a Mr. Stodart, surgical instrument maker, in
experimenting on alloys of steel with a view to improving
its quality. For many years after, we are told, Faraday
used to present his friends with razors made of a particular
alloy discovered at this time. The paper embodying
the results of these experiments in alloys was
duly published in the <cite>Quarterly Journal of Science</cite>.</p>

<p>A description of our hero (for hero he was&mdash;one of
our true "heroes of peace"), written by a friend about
the time of his marriage, is interesting as assisting us to
realise what manner of man he really was in the flesh.
"A young-looking man of about thirty years of age,
well made, and neat in his dress, his cheerfulness of
disposition often breaking out in a short crisp laugh, but
thoughtful enough when something important is to be
done."</p>

<p>We find Faraday now a young man of thirty, happily
married, with a large circle of friends who are finding
in him something of that genius which year by year
henceforward was to manifest itself; we find him not
only gaining the goodwill of these friends for his talents,
but gaining their affectionate regard by his unselfishness
and unremitting good nature. After their marriage in
June, 1821, Mr. and Mrs. Faraday took up their residence
in the Institution, where they continued to live
for close upon forty years. Although fortune seemed
thus to be smiling upon Michael Faraday it must not be
supposed that his position at the Royal Institution was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>highly remunerative one, his position was yet nominally
that of laboratory assistant, and the return which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
received for his services was a salary of one hundred
pounds per annum, a suite of rooms, and coal and gas.</p>

<p>One month after his marriage Faraday made his
confession of sin and profession of faith before the
Sandemanian Church. It is characteristic of his whole
attitude towards religion, and the great and serious
regard which it demands from every <em>individual</em>, that
when his wife asked him why he had not told her what
he was about to do, he simply yet earnestly answered,
"That is between me and my God." Truth in all things
was what he aimed at, and his whole life may be said to
be a seeking after truth in the various branches of knowledge;
to half know a thing was never sufficient for
him, he could not rest there; he must test its truth, and
either cast it away, having proved it worthless, or accept
it with delight, having proved its truth. This is evidenced
in all his life-work, in his social intercourse no less than
in his scientific work, in his letters and journals no less
than in his lectures and published papers.</p>

<p>A circumstantial account has appeared in some of
the newspapers of Faraday's secession from the Sandemanian
Church, and his penitent return to it. Not
having seen any reference to such a secession in the
biographies of Faraday I wrote to Miss Barnard, who
in the following note, most emphatically denies the truth
of the story:&mdash;"Faraday never seceded from the Church
of which he became a member early in life (1821). It
is true that for a few weeks in 1844 there was a cessation
of his communion with this Church, but the reasons
for this were absolutely private, and had nothing to do
with any conflict in his mind between his faith in the
Scriptures and his scientific work. The statement is
altogether without foundation, and neither the scene
described nor anything like it ever took place.</p>

<p>The year of Faraday's marriage which, as we have seen
in the previous chapter, was also important to him
in other ways, was marked by one unpleasant incident
which was talked about for some time afterward; but
although Faraday was then spoken of in no measured
terms, it has been conclusively shown that far from
any blame being attached to him, the facts of the case
are much to his credit. To put the matter shortly
it was this. Dr. Wollaston had an idea as to the possibility
of electro-magnetic rotation; he expected, in other
words, to be able to demonstrate that the "wire in the
voltaic circuit would revolve on its own axis." He was
at the Institution one day in the early part of 1821,
and was making an experiment in the laboratory with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Sir Humphry Davy. Faraday, who was not present
during the experiment, came in in time to hear the
conversation that followed. He afterwards made various
experiments on this subject, and was invited by the
editor of the <cite>Annals of Philosophy</cite> to contribute an historical
sketch of electro-magnetism. This sketch appeared
in the <cite>Annals</cite> of the same year; Faraday repeating
nearly all of the experiments to which he referred.
These experiments of Faraday's led him to the discovery,
early in September, of the "rotation of a wire in voltaic
current round a magnet, and of a magnet round the
wire." He could not make the wire and the magnet
revolve on their own axis. "There was not the slightest
indication that such was the case."</p>

<p>Before he published the paper descriptive of these
"new electro-magnetical motions," Faraday essayed to
see Dr. Wollaston that he might get permission to refer
to Wollaston's experiments. The doctor was out of
town, and the paper was published "by an error of
judgment" without any reference to his opinions and
intentions. Directly afterwards Faraday was extremely
distressed at hearing rumours which "affected his honour
and his honesty." He wrote at once, not only to Stodart,
but directly to Dr. Wollaston, whom he met, and after
mutual explanation the matter dropped. Faraday,
however, continued his electro-magnetic experiments.
It is one of these that is referred to by his brother-in-law,
who was with him one Christmas Day when: "All
at once he exclaimed, 'Do you see, do you see, do you
see, George?' as the small wire began to revolve. I
shall never forget the enthusiasm expressed in his face,
and the sparkling in his eyes."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1822 Faraday was at Swansea for a
fortnight with Phillips, the editor of the <cite>Philosophical
Magazine</cite>. Before starting, however, he took his wife and
her mother down to Ramsgate, whither he addressed to his
wife three letters, in which are evident the deep feelings
which were his in regard to their relations. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
letter was written on his arrival in town after leaving
Ramsgate. After detailing what he has done, he breaks
off, "And now, my dear girl, I must set business aside.
I am tired of the dull detail of things, and want to talk
of love to you; and surely there can be no circumstance
under which I can have more right. The theme was a
cheerful and delightful one before we were married, but
it is doubly so now.... Oh, my dear Sarah, poets may
strive to describe and artists to delineate the happiness
which is felt by two hearts truly and mutually loving
each other; but it is beyond their efforts, and beyond the
thoughts and conceptions of anyone who has not felt it.
I have felt it and do feel it, but neither I nor any other
man can describe it; nor is it necessary. We are happy,
and our God has blessed us with a thousand causes why
we should be so. Adieu for to-night."</p>

<p>The letters from Swansea give an account of his
journey, and of his host's house, of work at the copper
furnaces, and other places; of the many people there
are at Mr. Vivian's (with whom he was staying), and of
the late and long dinner, which he made up his mind
to avoid if possible. He stayed out walking one
evening, got back after dinner had commenced, and so
stole up to his own room that he might write a long
letter to his wife, in reply to one which he had received
from her. "I could almost rejoice at my absence from
you," he wrote, "if it were only that it has produced
such an earnest and warm mark of affection from you
as that letter. Tears of joy and delight fell from my
eyes on its perusal."</p>

<p>Early in the following year Faraday was experimenting
on chlorine, a subject that had attracted a great deal of
Davy's attention. At Davy's suggestion he enclosed
some of the gas in an hermetically sealed glass tube,
that he might "work with it under pressure, and see
what would happen by heat." What "happened" was
that on several occasions the tube exploded, twice doing
injury to Faraday's eyes. On one of the occasions when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Faraday was at work, Dr. Paris happened to enter the
laboratory, and seeing an oily liquid in the tube rallied
him on his carelessness in using dirty vessels. When,
afterwards, the end of the tube was filed off, there was
an explosion, and the oily matter disappeared. Early
on the following day Dr. Paris received this note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;The <em>oil</em> you noticed yesterday turns
out to be liquid chlorine.</p>

<p class='center'>
"Yours faithfully, <span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>He had in fact succeeded in converting chlorine gas
into a liquid by means of its own pressure. This was
an important discovery which led to numerous experiments
with other gases, and with like results.</p>

<p>On May 1st, 1823, Faraday's certificate as a candidate
for fellowship in the Royal Society was read for the
first time. Such a distinction was no doubt a coveted
one in Faraday's eyes, and it must have been extremely
painful to him when he found that Sir Humphry Davy
was opposed to his election. It is interesting to observe,
however, that the very first signature on his certificate
is that of Dr. Wollaston. Such being the case it seems
impossible that the old charge against Faraday in regard
to electro-magnetic rotation could have been revived, and
yet so it was. Wollaston himself had expressed perfect
satisfaction, and the matter seemed definitely settled.
Much as this revival of an untrue charge must have
distressed a man of Faraday's uncompromising integrity,
to find Davy, of all men, opposing him must have been
yet more distressing. That Davy's opposition was active
may be surmised from the following, which is told by
Faraday himself: "Sir H. Davy told me I must take
down my certificate. I replied that I had not put it
up; that I could not take it down, as it was put up by
my proposers. He then said I must get my proposers
to take it down. I answered that I knew they would
not do so. Then he said, I, as President, will take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
down. I replied that I was sure Sir H. Davy would
do what he thought was for the good of the Royal
Society."</p>

<p>This attitude of Davy's naturally pained Faraday
exceedingly; many years afterwards some allusion by a
friend to his early life led up to a mention of it; Faraday
rose abruptly from his seat, and took a rapid walk
up and down the room, saying, "Talk of something
else, and never let me speak of this again. I wish to
remember nothing but Davy's kindness." There were
tears in his eyes as he spoke, showing how deeply the
man was moved. Faraday also said that Davy had
walked for an hour about the courtyard of Somerset
House, arguing with one of his proposers that Faraday
should not be elected. We know none of the reasons
for Davy's opposition, and his attitude in this affair
must ever remain a cloud on his fair fame; that he, a
self-made man, who had risen to the first position among
modern chemists, should oppose at this stage of his
career a man somewhat similarly circumstanced, who
was also moving upwards step by step to one of the
highest positions among modern philosophers, as he loved
always to be called, is indeed as strange as it is regrettable.
The fact, sad as it is, has to be noted; but we
will not dwell upon it; more gratifying is it to learn how,
when the ballot was taken, Michael Faraday was almost
unanimously elected a Fellow of the Royal Society,
there being but one black ball. This, in after years, he
proudly mentioned, was the only one among his innumerable
honours that he had sought for. Scarce a
year passed afterwards but some fresh distinction was
conferred upon him.</p>

<p>Early in 1824 John Wilson Croker, with Sir Thomas
Lawrence, Sir F. Chantrey, and Sir H. Davy founded
the Athenæum Club, which still flourishes. For a short
while Faraday acted as honorary secretary to the Club;
but his more congenial scientific labours could not be
neglected, and he soon retired from the secretaryship, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
which he was succeeded by his friend Magrath, who
continued to hold the post for many years.</p>

<p>Faraday's notes and papers contributed to the scientific
journals and other periodicals were frequent, but it
would profit little here to detail them. One discovery he
made about this time is well worthy of mention as it has
had an important effect on a particular industry&mdash;the
discovery was that of benzol, benzine, or as Faraday
named it, "bicarburet of hydrogen." This is prepared
now in large quantities, being employed in the manufacture
of aniline colours.</p>

<p>We have it on the authority of Sir Roderick Murchison
that Faraday's first lecture at the Royal Institution was
delivered in the following circumstances. Brande, who
had succeeded Sir Humphry Davy as the Professor of
Chemistry, was delivering a course of lectures; one day
the lecturer, owing to illness or some other cause, was
absent, but his assistant (Faraday) took his place, and
lectured with so much ease that he won the complete
approval of his audience. In this connection too, it is
interesting to note that it was towards the close of this
same year that Faraday began his experiments in magnetic
electricity, the particular branch of research which
was to occupy a great part of his later life, and in which
he was destined to make some of his most brilliant
discoveries.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LABORATORY, ROYAL INSTITUTION.</div>
</div>

<p>It is pleasing to find that whatever may have been
Davy's object in opposing Faraday's election into the
Royal Society, he did not bear him any continued ill-will;
this is shown us not only by Davy's expressions of
goodwill in his letters, but by such things as an entry in
the minutes of a meeting of the managers of the Royal
Institution in February, 1825. From this entry we
learn that Sir Humphry Davy, "having stated that he
considered the talents and services of Mr. Faraday,
assistant in the laboratory, entitled to some mark of
approbation from the managers, and these sentiments
having met the cordial concurrence of the board;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span><em>Resolved</em>:&mdash;That Mr. Faraday be appointed Director of
the Laboratory, under the superintendence of the Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of Chemistry."</p>

<p>It was after receiving this appointment that Faraday
occasionally invited members of the Institution to evening
meetings in the laboratory, when he generally had
something new and interesting to show them. In these
meetings in the laboratory was the origin of those
regular Friday evening meetings in the theatre, which
commenced in 1826, which have had for many years a
world-wide reputation, and which have drawn together,
week after week and year after year, large numbers of
persons interested in science and in its popular exposition.
In 1826, the year in which the first regular Friday
evening meetings took place, seventeen lectures were
delivered, six of them being given by Faraday himself,
on such a variety of subjects as "Caoutchouc," "Lithography,"
"Brunel's Tunnel at Rotherhithe," etc. His
aim in inaugurating these "Friday evenings" may be
gathered from the scanty notes which he made for
introducing one of the earliest of the lectures:&mdash;"Evening
opportunities&mdash;interesting, amusing; instructive
also:&mdash;scientific research&mdash;abstract reasoning, but
in a popular way&mdash;dignity;&mdash;facilitate our object of
attracting the world, and making ourselves with science
attractive to it."</p>

<p>These notes, slight as they are, give us an idea of
what Faraday's objects were, and are at the same time
interesting, as they may fairly be said to represent the
aim of a large part of his lecturing work throughout his
career, the aim that is, which always seemed to be his,
to make the subject of which he was speaking amusing,
interesting, and instructive. No other man had ever
succeeded in attracting the world to science by making
the science attractive to them. High as is Faraday's
position as a scientist and philosopher, he is also to be
remembered with much gratitude as, in point of time as
well as of ability, the first of all true popularisers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
science. This may not at first sound a very high title to
bestow, but yet it is far from an insignificant one, and
one that must indeed have gratified Faraday; much as
he was pleased with the acknowledgment of himself as
one of their peers by such men as Davy, De la Rive, and
other scientists, the knowledge that he was interpreting
the wonders of Nature to a vast number of persons
hitherto ignorant, or in a measure ignorant, of her
marvellous ways, was yet more pleasing to him. We
can fully understand his echoing the sentiment which
the late James Russell Lowell, speaking of the poet,
expresses in the following beautiful verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1827 Faraday's first book&mdash;<cite>On Chemical Manipulation</cite>&mdash;was
produced. Faraday had published a short
while before an account of some discovery he had made
with respect to the existence of fluid sulphurs; in this
year he writes:&mdash;"I have just learned that Signor Bellani
had observed the same fact in 1813. M. Bellani complains
of the manner in which facts and theories which
have been published by him are afterwards given by
others as new discoveries; and though I find myself
classed with Gay-Lussac, Sir H. Davy, Daniell and
Bostock, in having thus erred, I shall not rest satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
without making restitution, for M. Bellani in this instance
certainly deserves it at my hand." This is
worthy of note as a slight illustration of the true integrity
of Faraday's character; much as he valued any
original discovery he might make, he valued much more
that absolute truth which made him render honour to
any predecessor even at his own expense; this was
done, too, always as a matter of course, without the
slightest spirit of grudging. His behaviour on such
occasions, which are indeed too trying to most persons,
had perhaps a great deal to do with the feeling which
he awakened in all who came in contact with him.
Never, perhaps, was there a more unselfish, as there
was never a more universally beloved, man. "His
friendship," as Professor Tyndall says, "was energy
and inspiration."</p>

<p>Faraday was appointed member of a "committee for
the improvement of glass for optical purposes;" one of
the results of his investigation was that when delivering,
in 1829, the Bakerian lecture at the Royal Institution,
he took for his subject, "The Manufacture of
Glass for Optical Purposes." For further investigation
of this subject a special experimenting room and furnace
had been built at the Institution in 1827, and a special
assistant&mdash;Sergeant Anderson&mdash;engaged to assist Faraday.
One chief object of these experiments was to
improve the glasses of telescopes. This desired result
was, however, not attained, although some notable work
was done; the glass then manufactured, for instance,
became invaluable in some of Faraday's later researches.
In 1830 the glass-making investigation stopped, and in
the year following the committee presented their report
to the Royal Society which had appointed them.</p>

<p>The recognition of Faraday's importance in the world
of science was now made more manifest each year; not
only were honours done him by various English and
Continental societies, but in 1826 the managers of the
Royal Institution "relieved him from his duty as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
chemical assistant at the lectures because of his occupation
in research." In 1829 he was invited to attend
the meetings of the managers. In 1827 he had been
offered the Professorship of Chemistry in London University,
but much as he felt the honour which was done
him, Faraday declined it, and from the noblest of
motives, as will be seen in this passage from his letter
to Dr. Lardner on the subject.</p>

<p>"I think it a matter of duty and gratitude on my
part to do what I can for the good of the Royal Institution
in the present attempt to establish it firmly. The
Institution has been a source of knowledge and pleasure
to me for the last fourteen years; and though it does not
pay me in salary for what I <em>now</em> strive to do for it, yet I
possess the kind feelings and goodwill of its authorities
and members, and all the privileges it can grant or I
require; and, moreover, I remember the protection it
has afforded me during the past years of my scientific
life."</p>

<p>In 1829 he was offered, and accepted, as it did not
interfere with his Royal Institution work, a post as
lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Academy, Woolwich.</p>

<p>In the same year died Sir Humphry Davy&mdash;the great
chemist to whom Faraday owed so much, and to whom,
as we have shown, he remained deeply attached to the
last. Davy had fought his way up as Faraday had
done, but, unlike Faraday, had been in a measure
spoiled by his success; he had very little self-control,
and but little method and order, and was, perhaps, too
anxious about his fame,&mdash;about how he would stand in
the eyes of men. With Faraday it was far different&mdash;he
aimed at truth in his knowledge, and cared but little
for what the world might consider as success. He was
known to say, referring to his experiments under Davy,
"that the greatest of all his great advantages was that
he had a model to teach him what to avoid." Faraday
and Davy were, nevertheless, friends to the last, and
the death of the latter at the comparatively early age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of fifty-two must have been a great blow to the
younger man.</p>

<p>The year 1831 is an important one in the life of
Michael Faraday, for it was then that he commenced
his brilliant series of experiments in electro-magnetism.
It is on his electrical research that his chief claim to
be remembered as a scientist rests. He had earlier
experimented in the same connection, but hitherto without
attaining the results which he had anticipated.
But from this time forward he devoted much energy to
this branch of research, with such success that if we
pick up any of the most recent works on electrical
science we inevitably find an important position given
in it to the name and discoveries of Michael Faraday.
This is not the place to enter into a description of these
experiments, though reference to them will of course be
made later on in this biography in the chapter devoted
to a consideration of Faraday's discoveries. In the
year 1833 Faraday was appointed Fullerian Professor
of Chemistry in the Royal Institution for life, without
the obligation of having to deliver lectures in connection
with the professorship.</p>

<p>In the year 1834 a boy living in a distant part of
England wrote to Professor Faraday, saying that he
was desirous of taking up a scientific career. Doubtless
remembering his own beginning, Faraday sent "by
return of post a kind and courteous reply," which that
boy, grown to man's estate, and known as Doctor J.
Scoffern, gratefully referred to in a graceful tribute
which he wrote after Faraday's death. It was during
this early part of Faraday's success that he once gave
evidence in a judicial case, when the scientific testimony
was so diverse that the judge, in summing up, levelled
something very like a reproach at the scientific witnesses,
saying, "Science has not shone this day." Faraday
would never again appear as a witness in a court
of law.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, the most fitting place in which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
can refer to some slight account of Faraday's home-life
in the Institution, which is given by his brother-in-law
George (Mrs. Faraday's youngest brother) and Miss
Reid (her niece). George Barnard was much with the
Faradays in these earlier times. "All the years I was
with Harding I dined at the Royal Institution," he
says. "After dinner we nearly always had our games
just like boys&mdash;sometimes at ball, or with horse-chestnuts
instead of marbles&mdash;Faraday appearing to enjoy
them as much as I did, and generally excelling us all.
Sometimes we rode round the theatre on a velocipede,
which was then a new thing." It is said "that sometimes
of an early summer morning the philosopher was
to be seen going up Hampstead Hill on this velocipede."
Barnard tells, too, of Faraday's unflagging good spirits
and his faculty for entering with keen enjoyment into
any fun that was going forward&mdash;pic-nics up the river,
with rustic cookery, charades, or anything else the
party seemed bent upon, Faraday would join in with
delight; how he used to attend Hullmandel's conversaziones,
where he met many of the leading singers and
artists of the day&mdash;Garcia and Malibran, Sir Edwin Landseer,
Clarkson Stanfield, J. M. W. Turner, and indeed
most of the members of the Royal Academy. The last-named
artist often applied to Faraday for chemical information
about his pigments; upon Turner, and all
artists who made similar requests, Faraday would
always impress the importance there was in their
prosecuting experiments with regard to their colours
themselves, giving them a hint to put some of their
colour and colour-washes in a bright sunlight, covering
up one half and leaving the other exposed, and then
observing the effect of light and gases on the latter.
Mr. Barnard says that during their various country
trips Faraday was in the habit of just "rambling about
geologising or botanising."</p>

<p>Mrs. Faraday's niece, Miss Reid, was peculiarly well
fitted to give reminiscences of her uncle, as she was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
nearly twenty years (from 1826) one of the family at
the Royal Institution. When she first went there Miss
Reid was only a little child; and when her aunt was
going out she was taken down to Faraday's laboratory,
where, as she afterwards wrote, "I had, of course, to
sit as still as a mouse, with my needlework; but my
uncle would often stop and give me a kind word or a
nod, or sometimes throw a bit of potassium into water
to amuse me."</p>

<p>"In all my childish troubles," Miss Reid continues,
"he was my never-failing comforter, and seldom too
busy, if I stole into his room, to spare me a few
minutes; and when perhaps I was naughty and rebellious,
how gently and kindly he would win me
round, telling me what he used to feel himself when
he was young, advising me to submit to the reproof
I was fighting against.</p>

<p>"I remember his saying that he found it a good
and useful rule to listen to all corrections quietly,
even if he did not see reason to agree with them.</p>

<p>"If I had a difficult lesson, a word or two from him
would clear away all my trouble; and many a long
wearisome sum in arithmetic became quite a delight
when he undertook to explain it."</p>

<p>The same lady gives some admirable notes of a
holiday the small family party spent at Walmer, in
Kent. How they drove down on the outside of the
coach, and how full of fun Faraday was, when they
reached Shooter's Hill, over Falstaff and the men in
buckram; "not a sight nor a sound of interest escaped
his quick eye and ear."</p>

<p>"At Walmer we had a cottage in a field, and my
uncle was delighted because a window looked directly
into a blackbird's nest built in a cherry tree. He
would go many times in a day to watch the parent
birds feeding their young."</p>

<p>Sunrise and sunset were never-failing sources of delighted
admiration to him; at such times he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
best of companions, and it has been described as a great
treat to watch the glorious sight with him.</p>

<p>"He carried Galpin's <cite>Botany</cite> in his pocket, and
used to make me examine any flower new to me as we
rested in the fields. The first we got at Walmer was
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Echium vulgare</i>, and is always associated in my
mind with his lesson. For when we met with it a
second time he asked, 'What is the name of that
flower?' 'Viper's bugloss,' said I. 'No, no, I must
have the Latin name,' said he."</p>

<p>On one occasion he called his wife and niece into his
room to "see a spectre." It was about ten o'clock in the
evening, a thick white mist had risen. He then placed
a candle behind them as they stood by the window,
and they saw two gigantic shadowy beings projected
on the mist and imitating, of course, every movement
they made. Faraday had gone to Walmer for rest and
refreshment, and his niece says that she, the young one of
the party, had to inveigle him away from his books
and papers to which he would return, and tempt him
out on some excursion to see or find something, on
which occasion he was nothing loth. We see, indeed,
at all times of his life how keen was the delight he
took in the company of young people; how beautifully
he could enter into the spirit which animated their
play, as though he was still a child himself, and this
valuable faculty was his up to the latest.</p>

<p>Of the Walmer excursion his niece further says:&mdash;"One
day he went far out among the rocks, and
brought home a great many wonderful things to show
me; for in those days I had never seen nor heard of
hermit crabs and sea anemones. My uncle seemed to
watch them with as much delight as I did; and how
heartily he would laugh at some of the movements of
the crabs! We went one night to look for glow-worms.
We searched every bank and likely place near, but not
one did we see. On coming home to our cottage he
espied a tiny speck of light on one of the doorposts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
It came from a small centipede; but though it was
put carefully under a glass, it never showed its light
again.</p>

<p>"My uncle read aloud delightfully. Sometimes he
gave us one of Shakespeare's plays or Scott's novels.
But of all things I used to like to hear him read <cite>Childe
Harold</cite>; and never shall I forget the way in which he
read the description of the storm on Lake Leman. He
took great pleasure in Byron, and Coleridge's 'Hymn
to Mont Blanc' delighted him. When anything
touched his feelings as he read&mdash;and it happened not
infrequently&mdash;he would show it not only by tears in his
voice, but by tears in his eyes also. Nothing vexed him
more than any kind of subterfuge or prevarication, or
glossing over things."</p>

<p>His niece mentioned on one occasion a professor who
had been discovered abstracting some manuscript from a
library. He instantly said, "What do you mean by
abstracting? You should say stealing; use the right
word, my dear."</p>

<p>Indecision of any kind Faraday could not bear; not
only should one decide, but quickly. Indeed he thought
that in trifling matters immediate decision was important;
it was better to decide incorrectly than to
remain hesitating. As soon as he left his study and
laboratory Faraday had the happy faculty of being able
to throw aside his science, and would, on going into the
sitting-room, "enter into all the nonsense that was
going on as heartily as any one; and as we sat round
the fire he would often play some childish game, at
which he was usually the best performer; or he would
take part in a charade, and I well recollect his being
dressed up to act the villain, and very fierce he looked.
Another time I recollect him as the learned pig."</p>

<div class="caption">FARADAY'S STUDY.</div>
</div>

<p>As we learn such things as these about him we cease
to wonder that Faraday was the object of so much
admiration and love from all persons, old and young,
with whom he came in contact. His wonderful work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>as a scientist will, it is to be hoped, never be remembered
as his only claim on our regard; for as one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the best and kindest and most helpful of men, whose
singular modesty and gentleness of character endeared
him to all, he certainly deserves to be kept ever in our
recollection. We must not, as a friend wrote of him,
allow the name of Faraday "to be nothing but a peg
on which to hang discoveries;" but must also recollect
that his "time, thoughts, purse, everything was freely
given to those who had need of them."</p>

<p>By the commencement of the year 1835 we find
Michael Faraday, not yet forty-four years of age,
generally acknowledged as one of their peers by the
leading men of science, not only in England but also on
the Continent. We find him elected member of many
of the most important scientific and philosophical societies
of this and other countries; we find him honoured by
the University of Oxford with the degree of D.C.L.;
and, as we shall shortly see, we find the Government
proposing to confer a pension on him in consideration of
the services which he has already rendered to science.
Truly a wonderful change to be wrought in the life of
a man who thirty years before was carrying round newspapers
as a common errand boy. It is, however, always
gratifying to note, and especially pleasing to remember,
that however successful he might be, Faraday was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
spoiled by the honours that were done him; he was
always the same kindly, helpful, simple man that he
had been. Those persons who had the great good
fortune to visit him at the Royal Institution, either at
the time of which we are treating or during his later life,
never failed to find a cordial welcome; "a friendly
chat in those quiet rooms was one of the greatest
pleasures it was possible to enjoy. The frugal simplicity
of the furniture was characteristic of Faraday."</p>

<p>The Faradays lived quietly to themselves at the
Institution, though they often, after the Friday evening
lectures, went round to Berkley Street to tea to Mr.
Richard Barlow's house, that gentleman and his
wife always being at home to their friends after
the Friday evenings. On such occasions as these
gatherings, Faraday, we learn, used to be the centre of
much interest and delight; for he had, as may be
gathered from what has already been said of his character,
that happy disposition which placed him at once in
sympathy with any person with whom he might be speaking;
especially was this rare sympathy his with regard
to children, with whom he seemed at once able to place
himself on an equal footing; and this it was that made
his lectures to young people not only so interesting but
so widely popular as they were. This subject, however,
deserves fuller consideration, and will be found treated
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Had he chosen to do so at this period of his career,
Faraday might have been in receipt of a pretty considerable
income. In 1830, indeed, he had undertaken
several commercial analyses, and his income from this
source alone came to as much as a thousand pounds.
Such work interfered with his research, and was therefore
unhesitatingly given up, and two years afterwards
his professional gains amounted to but little more than
a hundred and fifty pounds for the year, and in after
years they did not reach even that sum.</p>

<p>Early in 1835 Faraday received an intimation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Sir James South that had Sir Robert Peel remained in
office he had intended conferring a pension upon him.
Faraday wrote in reply, saying that he could not accept
a pension. The matter after this remained in abeyance
for a while. During the summer Faraday spent a short
holiday in Switzerland, whence he wrote to his old
friend Magrath: "The weather has been most delightful,
and everything in our favour, so that the scenery
has been in the most beautiful condition. Mont Blanc,
above all, is wonderful, and I could not but feel at it
what I have often felt before, that painting is very far
beneath poetry in cases of high expression; of which
this is one. No artist should try to paint Mont Blanc;
it is utterly out of his reach. He cannot convey an
idea of it, and a formal mass or a commonplace model
conveys more intelligence, even with respect to the sublimity
of the mountain, than his highest efforts can do.
In fact, he must be able to dip his brush in light and
darkness before he can paint Mont Blanc. Yet the
moment one sees it Lord Byron's expressions come to
mind, as they seem to apply. The poetry and the
subject dignify each other."</p>

<p>In the autumn of the same year, shortly after his
return from the Continent, the subject of a pension for
Faraday was re-opened. The independence and openness
of his character came out in a remarkable manner
in this matter. He was asked to wait upon Lord
Melbourne, the Prime Minister, at the Treasury, which
he did on October 26th. However he may have spoken
of Faraday personally, Lord Melbourne spoke of literary
and scientific men with but scant courtesy, and in effect
seemed to consider the awarding them pensions as a
piece of State humbug. We have seen how Faraday
resented a slur cast upon science in a court of law, and
he was no less indignant on this occasion; he returned
home and wrote a letter, the tone of which though
dignified was very decided. This letter, in which he
declined to accept or even further to consider the acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of a pension from the Government, Faraday
intended to forward at once to Lord Melbourne. He
finally, however, allowed somewhat wiser counsels to
prevail; his father-in-law, while justly proud of Michael's
scientific attainments, was also a shrewd business-like
man, and persuaded him to write a letter, which,
although it was not one whit less dignified in its tone
was less decided in its refusal of the proposed pension.</p>

<p>After many fruitless efforts to make Faraday change
his decision, a lady, who was a friend both of the
philosopher and of the Prime Minister, asked the
former what he would require at the hand of Lord
Melbourne to make him change his mind on the subject.
"I should require," he replied, "from his lordship
what I have no right or reason to expect that he
would grant&mdash;a written apology for the words he permitted
himself to use to me." To Melbourne's credit,
be it said, that as soon as he knew of this he apologised
amply for, as he expressed it, the "too blunt and inconsiderate
manner in which he had expressed himself."</p>

<p>On December 24th of the same year the pension of
three hundred pounds a year was awarded to Michael
Faraday for his services to the cause of science. A
pension, it may here be mentioned, half of which was
continued to the Professor's widow, and on her death
to his niece, Miss Jane Barnard. He was not yet
forty-five, we must recollect, when he was thought to
have fairly earned this reward. Early in 1836 further
honour was done to him by his being appointed scientific
adviser to the Trinity House; in accepting the position
he wrote a characteristic letter, of which the following
is a portion; it was addressed to Captain Pelly, Deputy-Master:
"I consider your letter to me as a great
compliment, and should view the appointment at the
Trinity House, which you propose, in the same light;
but I may not accept even honours without due consideration.
In the first place my time is of great value
to me, and if the appointment you speak of involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
anything like periodical routine attendances I do not
think I could accept it. But if it meant that in consultation,
in the examination of proposed plans and
experiments, in trials, etc., made as my convenience
would allow, and with an honest sense of a duty to
be performed, then I think it would consist with my
present engagements.... In consequence of the goodwill
and confidence of all around me, I can at any
moment convert my time into money, but I do not
require more of the latter than is sufficient for necessary
purposes. The sum, therefore, of £200 is quite
enough in itself, but not if it is to be the indicator
of the character of the appointment. But I think
you do not view it so, and that you and I understand
each other in that respect; and your letter confirms me
in that opinion. The position which I presume you
would wish me to hold is analogous to that of a standing
counsel. As to the title it might be what you pleased
almost. Chemical adviser is too narrow; for you would
find me venturing into parts of the philosophy of light
not chemical. Scientific adviser (the title afterwards
decided upon) you may think too broad&mdash;or in me too
presumptuous&mdash;and so it would be, if by it was understood
all science.... The thought occurs to me
whether, after all, you want such a person as myself.
This you must judge of; but I always entertain a fear
of taking an office in which I may be of no use to those
who engage me."</p>

<p>This letter is, as I have said, characteristic of the
writer; it is characteristic of his sensitiveness to any
honour done to him, and of his unworldliness, of his
conscientiousness in making sure that he will be able to
perform anything that he may undertake, and of a half-diffidence
with regard to himself as to whether he was
able to do all that was anticipated of him. For nearly
thirty years, with credit to himself and to the Brethren
of the Trinity House, did Michael Faraday continue as
their scientific adviser. Frequently do we find him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
experimenting on lights and lighting&mdash;visiting the
various lighthouses round the coast, trying the electric
light for them, comparing the various lights, and reporting
to the Brethren&mdash;such work as this is, as has been
said, to be frequently noted in looking over a record of
the mass of work which during these years Faraday
was doing. It is pleasing to notice here that on her
husband's death Mrs. Faraday presented such of his
portfolios, of well-ordered and indexed manuscripts, as
referred to this part of his work to the Trinity House.
So carefully were these notes made and kept that it is
possible now to refer quite easily to any particular piece
of work on which Faraday was engaged during these
thirty years.</p>

<p>In this same year (1836) there appeared the <cite>Life of
Sir Humphry Davy</cite>, by his brother, Dr. John Davy.
In this work statements were made with relation to
Faraday and his patron which were not true; and
painful indeed though it must have been to the former,
he felt compelled to deny them. This he did in a long
letter to his friend R. Phillips, editor of the <cite>Philosophical
Magazine</cite>, in which periodical the letter was
published. "I regret," Faraday wrote, "that Dr. Davy
has made that necessary which I did not think before
so; but I feel that I cannot, after his observation,
indulge my earnest desire to be silent on the matter,
without incurring the risk of being charged with something
opposed to an <em>honest</em> character. This I dare not
risk; but in answering for myself I trust that it will be
understood that I have been driven unwillingly into
utterance."</p>

<p>The subject must indeed have been a painful one; to
have to assert his own right to be the discoverer of
certain chemical results which were being credited to
Davy. In one or two cases, when he found that he had
been preceded in the discovery of anything he was the
first to acknowledge that all honour was due to his
predecessor, and that strict regard for true honesty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
all things very properly would not allow him to be
silent now. He concludes his letter to Phillips in these
words, "Believing that I have now said enough to
preserve my own 'honest fame' from any injury it
might have risked from the mistakes of Dr. Davy, I
willingly bring this letter to a close, and trust that I
shall never again have to address you on the subject."</p>

<p>It was at about this time that another incident
occurred which illustrates Faraday's absolute integrity
of character&mdash;integrity that would not wink at anything
that was in the slightest degree not straightforward,
even though it was against his own interest, which,
indeed, rather shunned doing a good deed that might
seem dictated by mere self-interest. His brother was
working at the time as a gas-fitter, and there was a
possibility of his getting the Athenæum Club work in
connection with his trade. Michael, writing on the
subject, said, "Few things would please me more than
to help my brother in his business, or than to know that
he had got the Athenæum work; but I am exceedingly
jealous of myself, lest I should endeavour to have that
done for him as my brother which the Committee might
not like to do for him as a tradesman, and it is this
which makes me very shy of saying a word about the
matter."</p>

<p>During these years Faraday was getting through a
vast quantity of work, his experimental researches in
electricity were taking up a great part of his time, but
other matters were not neglected. He was frequently
lecturing before the Royal Institution or the Royal
Society; while he wrote a large number of scientific
papers for the various philosophical periodicals to which
he contributed. Besides presenting series after series of
his brilliant <cite>Experimental Researches</cite> to the Royal Society,
he had also to attend to his lectures at Woolwich, and
his work for the Trinity House. He must indeed, hard-working
man that he was, have found his long day
very fully occupied; and it is scarcely to be wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
at that in 1839 the strain began to tell upon him, and a
period of rest became necessary. As years went on,
such periods of rest were more frequent and yet more
vitally important.</p>

<p>In 1837 the British Association<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> held its Annual
Meeting at Liverpool, and Faraday attended it, and was
made, as he put it, "a most responsible person," President
of the Chemical section. From Liverpool he wrote home
to his wife, "To-day I think we made our section rather
more interesting than was expected, and to-morrow I
expect will be good also. In the afternoon Daniell and
I took a quiet walk; in the evening he dined with me
here. We have been since to a grand conversazione at
the Town Hall, and I have now returned to my room to
talk with you as the pleasantest and happiest thing I
can do. Nothing rests me so much as communion with
you. I feel it even now as I write; and I catch myself
saying the words aloud as I write them, as if you were
within hearing. Dear girl, think of me till Saturday
evening. I find I can get home very well by that time;
so you may expect me.</p>

<p>"Ever, my dear Sarah, your affectionate husband,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday.</span>"</p>

<p>This reference to getting home on Saturday evening
is especially interesting, for Faraday always took his
wife home to her father's house every Saturday evening,
that she might see her family; they all went to church
together on the Sunday. This was an unvarying rule
of Faraday's for very many years, as long, indeed, as it
was possible.</p>

<p>Faraday's mother, after having lived to see "her
Michael" come to be one of the great men of his time,
died at Islington in March, 1838. The loss must have
been keenly felt by Faraday, for between mother and
son the tenderest affection had always subsisted. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>was justly proud of the position which her boy had won
for himself; and he ever retained that beautiful chivalrous
kindness and deference to his mother that had
characterised him all along. The passages from his
earlier letters to his mother which have been given in
previous pages are evidence of this, and his kindly
consideration was ever the same. Much as the death of
his mother, and, a few years later, of his brother Robert,
affected him, Faraday had in his beautiful clear-sighted
faith in his religion a source of inextinguishable solace,
and looking forward to a reunion hereafter could see a
"beautiful and consoling influence in the midst of all
these troubles."</p>

<p>Severe and long-continued mental work, as I have
said, began to tell upon Faraday in 1839, and he was
ordered by his doctor to take an absolute rest. He
suffered from loss of memory and similar symptoms of
an overworked brain. His wife, as her niece tells us,
used to carry him off to Brighton, or somewhere down
into the country for a few days when he became dull
and low-spirited, and the rest soon restored him.
During such a sojourn at Brighton, towards the close of
1839, Professor Brande wrote to him, saying that the
doctor said Faraday was to remain thoroughly idle
for a time; and he (Brande) kindly offered at the
same time to do anything he could to relieve
Faraday of any routine work. He had indeed read
some of Faraday's electricity lectures at the Institution,
although, as he terms it in his letter to Faraday,
"he began to fear the fate of Phæton in the chariot
of Ph&oelig;bus." As yet, however, Faraday would not
take a very long-continued rest, and he was before
long back in Albemarle Street working, although less
than he had been doing.</p>

<p>In the year 1840 Faraday's health made it necessary
that his scientific labours should be reduced, and just
about this time, although he was still adding to his
series of <cite>Experimental Researches</cite>, he was husbanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
his strength as far as possible. This year, too, deserves
especial note, for it was now that he became an elder
in the Sandemanian Church; he had before on some
occasions exhorted those present at week-day meetings,
but it now devolved upon him to deliver regular
sermons. Faraday, as we have already seen, on
more than one occasion, was not a man to undertake
anything without doing it to the best of his abilities;
and if this was his character in matters of everyday
concern, how much more so should we expect it to be,
and not without reason, his character in so vital a
question as that concerning his religion. Or perhaps it
would be more correct to say concerning the more
obvious exercise of his religious faith, for the spirit of
his religion coloured all that he did; it was indeed the
moving force of his soul, and was not confined to any
narrow circle.</p>

</div>

<p>The flow and energy which characterised Faraday as
a lecturer were replaced in his sermons by a simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>and earnestness that together are best described as true
devoutness. His sermons were always extemporary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
although the outlines of them were carefully prepared
beforehand, a small card having noted down on either
side of it the heads of the elder's discourse and reference
to such passages in the Bible as he wanted to quote.
One of these cards is given that it may show with what
slight notes the earnest and reverent preacher provided
himself. A friend, describing him officiating at the
chapel, which was situated in Paul's Alley, Redcross
Street, City, but which has long since been pulled down,
and the Church transferred to Barnsbury Grove, N.,
said, "He read a long portion of one of the Gospels
slowly, reverently, and with such an intelligent and
sympathising appreciation of the meaning, that I thought
I had never before heard so excellent a reader."<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center" style="font-weight:bold">COPY OF ONE OF THE CARDS FROM WHICH FARADAY PREACHED.</p>
</div>

<p>Another of his listeners said, "His object seemed to
be to make the most use of the words of Scripture, and
to make as little of his own words as he could. Hence
a stranger was struck first by the number and rapidity
of his references to texts in the Old and New Testaments,
and secondly, by the devoutness of his manner."
Yet another friend, who had been privileged to hear
Faraday preach before his small flock, said of his
sermons, "They struck me as resembling a mosaic work
of texts. At first you could hardly understand their
juxtaposition and relationship; but as the well-chosen
pieces were filled in by degrees their congruity and
fitness became developed, and at last an amazing sense
of the power and beauty of the whole filled one's
thoughts at the close of the discourse."</p>

<p>This, his first period of eldership in the Church, continued
from 1840 until 1844, when a slight misunderstanding
having arisen between himself and the
brethren, he for a time relinquished the office; occupying
it again, however, later on in life. His earnest
religious feeling was an abiding source of consolation
to him in all his trials; it affected in no slight degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his life and life-work at all points, although, to his credit
be it said, that it was rather the spirit of his religious
feeling which was thus manifested, and it is not by any
means to be understood that he was in even the slightest
degree given to cant, such a thing being far from possible
with him. His religion was a something too sacred and
too immediately between himself and his God, as he
said, for him to refer to it, except when circumstances
especially called for it. Then, in the earnest sympathetic
words of comfort, which he addressed to those
persons with whom he was intimate when they were in
trouble, we may trace the true deep current of religion,
which was so essentially a part of his nature.</p>

<p>It is interesting to connect the name of our philosopher
with a great institution such as the establishment
of the penny post. In 1840 Sir Rowland Hill
tells us in his autobiography that he was sorely puzzled
to find an ink that, having obliterated the postage
stamps, should not be removable. "In my anxiety,"
he says, "I went so far as to trouble the greatest
chemist of the age. Kindly giving me the needful
attention, though in an extremely depressed state of
health, the result of excessive labour, a fact, of course,
unknown to me when I made the application, Mr.
Faraday approved of the course which I submitted to
him: viz., that an aqueous ink should be used both
for the stamp and for obliteration."</p>

<p>Referring to this same year we find an interesting
entry in Crabb Robinson's Diary. "<em>May 8th.</em>&mdash;Attended
Carlyle's second lecture.... It gave great
satisfaction, for it had uncommon thoughts and was
delivered with unusual animation.... In the evening
heard a lecture by Faraday. What a contrast to
Carlyle! A perfect experimentalist, with an intellect
so clear! Within his sphere, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">un uomo compito</i>. How
great would that man be who could be as wise on Mind
and its relations as Faraday is on Matter!"</p>

<p>Faraday's life as a scientific experimentalist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
discoverer is divided into two periods by an interval of
four years, during which he did but little, or, compared
with his previous performances but little, work. Such
a time of rest was indeed rendered absolutely necessary
by loss of memory and giddiness, which had troubled
him occasionally before, and which now put a stop to
his experiments. This period of partial rest commenced
with a three months' trip in Switzerland, where he was
accompanied by his wife and her brother. Dr. Bence
Jones says, "In different ways he showed much of his
character during this period of rest. The journal he
kept of his Swiss tour is an image of himself. It was
written with excessive neatness, and it had the different
mountain flowers which he gathered in his walks fixed
in it as few but Faraday himself could have fixed them.
His letters are free from the slightest sign of mental
disease. His only illness was overwork, and his only
remedy was rest."</p>

<p>A few passages from this Swiss journal are all that
can be given. The first stay of any length was made at
Thun, whence many walking excursions were undertaken,
sometimes indeed Faraday walking as much as forty-five
miles in the one day, a sufficient proof that he was
not at all bodily ill. The journal gives us many a word-picture
of the scenery and of the people, with now and
then quaint observations and humorous reflections; let
the following passages speak for themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>July 18th.</em>&mdash;Took a long walk to the valley called
the Simmenthal, which goes off from the valley of the
lake.... The frogs were very beautiful, lively, vocal,
and intelligent, and not at all fearful. The butterflies,
too, became familiar friends with me, as I sat under the
trees on the river's bank. It is wonderful how much
intelligence all these animals show when they are
treated kindly and quietly; when, in fact, they are
treated as having their right and part in creation,
instead of being frightened, oppressed, and destroyed.</p>

<p>"<em>Monday, 19th.</em>&mdash;Very fine day; walk with dear Sarah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
on the lake side to Oberhofen, through the beautiful
vineyards; very busy were the women and men in trimming
the vines, stripping off leaves and tendrils from
fruit-bearing branches. The churchyard was beautiful,
and the simplicity of the little remembrance posts set
upon the graves very pleasant. One who had been too
poor to put up an engraved brass plate, or even a painted
board, had written with ink on paper the birth and
death of the being whose remains were below, and this
had been fastened to a board and mounted on the top of
a stick at the head of the grave, the paper being protected
by a little edge and roof. Such was the simple
remembrance; but nature had added her pathos, for
under the shelter by the writing a caterpillar had
fastened itself and passed into its death-like state of
chrysalis; and having ultimately assumed its final state
it had winged its way from the spot, and had left the
corpse-like relics behind. How old and how beautiful
is this figure of the resurrection! surely it can never
appear before our eyes without touching the thoughts.</p>

<p>"<em>Tuesday, 27th.</em>&mdash;More pleasant rambles: fine. Now
we shall think of a move, and really the changing character
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d'hôte</i> and other things make me in
love with the thoughts of home. Dear England, dear
home! dear friends! I long to be in and among them
all; and where can I expect to be more happy, or better
off in anything? Dear home, dear friends, what is all
this moving, and bustle, and whirl, and change worth
compared to you?</p>

<p>"<em>August 2nd.</em>&mdash;Interlaken.... The Jungfrau has
been occasionally remarkably fine: in the morning
particularly, covered with tiers of clouds, whilst the
snow between them was beautifully distinct; and in the
evening showing a beautiful series of tints from the base
to the summit, according to the proportion of light on
the different parts. At one time the summit was beautifully
bathed in golden light, whilst the middle part
was quite blue, and the snow of its peculiar blue-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
colour in the clefts.... Clout-nail making goes on
here rather considerably, and is a very neat and pretty
operation to observe. I love a smith's shop, and anything
relating to a smithy. My father was a smith."</p>

<p>How beautiful is the following description of the
waterfall at Brienz Lake: "The sun shone brightly, and
the rainbows seen from various points were very beautiful.
One at the bottom of a fine but furious fall was
very pleasant. There it remained motionless, whilst the
gusts and clouds of spray swept furiously across its place,
and were dashed against the rock. It looked like a
spirit strong in faith and steadfast in the storm of passions
sweeping across it; and though it might fade and revive,
still it held on to the rock as in hope, and giving hope,
and the very drops which in the whirlwind of their fury
seemed as if they would carry all away were made to
revive it and give it greater beauty."</p>

<p>At length, on September 29th, the small party reach
London again, and Faraday's journal ends thus:&mdash;"Crossing
the new London Bridge street we saw
M.'s pleasant face, and shook hands; and though we
separated in a moment or two, still we feel and know we
are where we ought to be&mdash;at home."</p>

<p>Faraday's allusion to his father in the extract above
is very pleasing and interesting. We are told that he
used to like to pay visits to the scenes of his boyhood
and youth, and that he once went to the shop where
his father had formerly been employed as a blacksmith,
and asked to be allowed to look over the place. When
he got to a part of the premises at which there was an
opening into the lower workshop, he stopped and said,
"I very nearly lost my life there once. I was playing
in the upper room at pitching halfpence into a pint pot
close by this hole, and having succeeded at a certain
distance, I stepped back to try my fortune further off,
forgetting the aperture, and down I fell; and if it had
not been that my father was working over an anvil
fixed just below, I should have fallen on it, broken my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
back, and probably killed myself. As it was, my father's
back just saved mine."</p>

<p>On his return from his Swiss trip, Faraday took up a
great part of his work again, and was fully occupied with
a few electrical experiments, lectures, and Trinity House
work. What has been termed his second great period of
research did not commence until 1845. He lectured
frequently at the Institution&mdash;so frequently indeed that
we cannot refer to them here, but must leave them to
the chapter on his lectures. Indeed, merely to detail
the work which Faraday did would take up considerably
more than the whole space of this little book.</p>

<p>In 1844 Faraday became one of the special commissioners
appointed to investigate the Haswell colliery
explosion. In 1846 his brother Robert met with a
fatal accident, and Faraday writes to his wife, who was
staying at Tunbridge Wells:&mdash;"Dear Heart,&mdash;....
Come home, dear. Come and join in the sympathy and
comfort needed by many.... My sister and her
children have not forgotten the hope in which they were
joined together with my dear Robert, and I see its
beautiful and consoling influence in the midst of all
these troubles. I and you, though joined in the same
trouble, have part in the same hope. Come home,
dearest.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="ind55">"Your affectionate husband,</span></p>

<p class="marginright">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday.</span>"</p>

<p>In 1849 he delivered his famous lectures on "The
Chemical History of a Candle;" and in the following
year he gave a series of six lectures on "Some Points of
Domestic Chemical Philosophy&mdash;a Fire, a Candle, a
Lamp, a Chimney, a Kettle, Ashes." His work during
these years is shown in his many published letters, in
his correspondence which for years he maintained with
many of the leading scientists, not only in England but
abroad&mdash;with De la Rive, Liebig, Humboldt, etc. His
work, however, cannot be particularised, neither can the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
many honours that year after year were awarded to him.
We find that he was a man nearly sixty years of age, in
the front rank of the great chemists of his country,
and acknowledged as such on every hand, and yet we
find that he was still the same energetic and enthusiastic
scientist, the same kindly and unselfish friend, the same
honest and disinterested man that we have seen him
all through. Such, indeed, he continued until the very
last, his character but "deepening"&mdash;as he said of his love
for his wife&mdash;as the years passed by. His chivalrous
deference to women of all ages and ranks was also a
remarkable feature of his character, no less at this later
part of his life, than when he was a younger man; his
chivalry has, indeed, been often referred to, but it was,
I learn from Miss Barnard, one of his most readily
observed good qualities.</p>

<p>The year of the Great Exhibition was a busy one for
Faraday; he was working in his old accustomed,
unremitting manner at his magnetic, and electric, and
general experiments, he was continuing to write those
<cite>Experimental Researches</cite> which he sent in to the Royal
Society, and upon which rests so large a part of his
reputation as a scientist. He had given up his professorship
at Woolwich Academy the previous year.
He was lecturing, however, a good deal, and not alone
on his own account, for during the summer he delivered
a lecture on ozone for his good friend Professor
Schönbein. His health, however, was far from being
as good as it had been, and he had to take frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rests; so that, although he was working as earnestly
and enthusiastically as ever, it was, so to speak, only
intermittently. That the loss of memory from which
he had before suffered was still afflicting him at times,
is made evident by such passages from his letters as the
following pathetic one from a letter to Schönbein: "I
have no doubt I answer your letters very badly; but,
my dear friend, <em>do you remember</em> that <em>I forget</em>, and that
I can no more help it than a sieve can help the water
running out of it. Still you know me to be your old
and obliged and affectionate friend, and all I can say
is, the longer I know you the more I seem to cling to
you. Ever, my dear Schönbein, yours affectionately."</p>

<p>A pathetic interest attaches to the following reminiscence
of Faraday by his niece (Miss Jane Barnard);
she was reading to him an anecdote of the Duke of
Marlborough's intimation to the king that as he felt
that the time when his faculties would fade had arrived
he did not wish again to attend any Council meeting,
and that if he should attend he desired that no heed
should be given to anything he said. Faraday after
listening attentively to it, asked Miss Barnard to read
that anecdote to him if at any time she felt that his
judgment no longer controlled his wishes.</p>

<p>So numerous were the honours which were showered
upon Michael Faraday during the last forty years of
his life, that to enumerate them would be as tedious as it
would be profitless; suffice it to say that he was elected
a member of all the chief scientific and philosophical
bodies in Europe. Indeed it is said that a Continental
Professor addressed a letter to him as "Professor
Michael Faraday, Member of all the learned Societies
of Europe." It is worthy of note, however, that he
was elected a member of the Senate of the University
of London, and was asked to act as examiner for the
same body, but declined.</p>

<p>During the periods of rest which his failing health
made necessary, Faraday would go off to Brighton or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Hastings with his wife, where he would spend a few
days in quiet idleness. In February, 1851, he was at
Brighton, where Mr. Masquerier, the French refugee
who had in early life given him lessons in geometry,
was living. In Crabb Robinson's diary the following
entry, which is of much interest to us here, occurs
against February 18: "(At Masquerier's, Brighton.)
We had calls soon after breakfast. The one to be
mentioned was that of Faraday, one of the most remarkable
men of the day, the very greatest of our discoverers
in chemistry, a perfect lecturer in the unaffected
simplicity and intelligent clearness in his statement; so
that the learned are instructed and the ignorant charmed.
His personal character is admirable. When he was
young, poor, and altogether unknown, Masquerier was
kind to him; and now that he is a great man he does
not forget his old friend."</p>

<p>An interesting story is told by Dr. Scoffern of an
incident that happened during this year; an incident
that illustrates in a remarkable manner the unaltered
good humour and geniality which belonged to Faraday
as much during his later as his earlier years. Professor
Brande was lecturing at the time on a newly-discovered
method of purifying sugar by sugar of lead; while they
were in the laboratory Scoffern accidentally let fall a
retort of corrosive liquid. In an instant, he tells us,
Professor Faraday "threw some soda upon the floor;
then down on his hands and knees he went, slop cloth
in hand, like any humble housemaid. Laughing, I
expressed my desire to photograph him then and there;
he demurred to the pose, begged me to consult his
dignity, and began laughing with a childish joyousness.
Hilariously boyish upon occasion he could be, and
those who knew him best, knew he was never more at
home, that he never seemed so pleased as when making
an 'old boy' of himself, as he was wont to say, lecturing
before a juvenile audience at Christmas."</p>

<p>Faraday, as has been said earlier, attended some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the annual meetings of the British Association; in this
year of 1851 the meeting was held at Ipswich, and on that
occasion Dr. J. H. Gladstone says he first met Faraday
to have any intercourse with him. "I watched him,"
he writes, "with all the interest of an admiring disciple,
and there is deeply engraven on my memory the vivacity of
his conversation, the eagerness with which he entered
into some mathematico-chemical speculations of Dumas,
and the playfulness with which, when we were dining
together, he cut boomerangs out of card, and shot them
across the table at his friends."</p>

<p>Yet another story of Faraday's remarkable disinterestedness
is given us by Dr. Scoffern, who, writing
of the year 1852, says that he had made an abstract of
a course of lectures which Faraday had delivered on the
subject of the non-metallic elements; this abstract he
wished to embody in a book which he was about to
publish. The kindly old chemist at once gave his
permission, and would not even listen to any proposal
as to sharing the profits of the work. Scoffern immediately
suggested that he would be misunderstood by
the publisher, who would not be able to comprehend
such a piece of generosity on the great professor's part.
"Oh," said Faraday, "we'll soon settle that by writing;"
and he wrote out a formal letter of assignment.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that his time was always fully
occupied, Faraday found time to write many letters, not
only the long friendly, yet scientific letters to such men
as De la Rive and Schönbein, but letters of advice and
sympathy to his nephews and nieces, and other friends.
His advice was always given in so kindly a spirit that it
could not be taken amiss, and his sympathy was tendered
in that rare manner&mdash;sincere and unostentatious&mdash;which
characterises this feeling in its highest manifestation.
The following passage, from a letter to his nephew, Frank
Barnard, who was just starting life, is an illustration
of this: "And so you are hard at work, and somewhat
embarrassed by your position; but no man can do just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
he likes, and in many things he has to give way, and may
do so honourably, provided he preserves his self-respect.
Never, my dear Frank, lose that, whatever may be the
alternative. Let no one tempt you to it, for nothing
can be expedient that is not right; and though some of
your companions may tease you at first, they will respect
you for your consistency in the end; and if they pretend
not to do so it is of no consequence. However, I trust
the hardest part of your probation is over, for the
earliest is usually the hardest, and that you know how
to take all things quietly."</p>

<p>Although I have made but little special reference to
the work on which our great hero was engaged when
treating of different periods of his life; it becomes
necessary here to refer to the part which Faraday took in
exposing a popular delusion which was widely believed
in at the time, and which yet has many supporters&mdash;the
delusion as to table-turning. He wrote a long account
fully exposing the error which so many people were
willing to believe; and although his exposure convinced
most persons who troubled themselves to follow him in
his investigations, the popular mind refused to be disillusionised,
and the turning of the tables was referred to
electricity, magnetism, spirits, a new natural force, and
other agencies. This occasion perhaps drew more
emphatic utterance from Faraday than any other; he
had no patience with people who would not be enlightened,
and his feeling is shown in a letter written in
July, 1853, to Professor Schönbein: "I have not been
at work except in turning the tables upon the table-turners,
nor should I have done that, but that so many
inquiries poured in upon me, that I thought it better to
stop the inpouring flood by letting all know at once
what my views and thoughts were. What a weak,
credulous, incredulous, unbelieving, superstitious, bold,
frightened,&mdash;what a ridiculous world ours is, as far as
concerns the mind of man. How full of inconsistencies,
contradictions, and absurdities it is. I declare that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
taking the average of many minds that have recently
come before me (and apart from that spirit which God
has placed in each), and accepting for a moment that
average as a standard, I should far prefer the obedience,
affections, and instincts of a dog before it. Do not
whisper this, however, to others. There is One above
who worketh in all things, and who governs even in
the midst of that misrule to which the tendencies and
powers of men are so easily perverted."</p>

<p>In his Juvenile Lectures, delivered at Christmas of
the same year, he again referred to this popular error,
giving at the same time some sound advice to his young
friends. "In conclusion, I must address a few words to
the intending philosophers who form the juvenile part
of my audience. Study science with earnestness&mdash;search
into nature&mdash;elicit the truth&mdash;reason on it, and reject
all which will not stand the closest investigation. Keep
your imagination within bounds, taking heed lest it run
away with your judgment. Above all, let me warn you
young ones of the danger of being led away by the
superstitions which at this day of boasted progress are
a disgrace to the age, and which afford astonishing
proofs of the vast floods of ignorance overflowing and
desolating the highest places.</p>

<p>"Educated man, misusing the glorious gift of reason
which raises him above the brute, actually lowers himself
below the creatures endowed only with instinct;
inasmuch as he casts aside the natural sense which
might guide him, and in his credulous folly pretends to
discover and investigate phenomena which reason would
not for a moment allow, and which, in fact, are utterly
absurd.</p>

<p>"Let my young hearers mark and remember my
words. I desire that they should dwell in their memory
as a protest uttered in this Institution against the progress
of error. Whatever be the encouragement it may
receive elsewhere, may we, at any rate in this place,
raise a bulwark which shall protect the boundaries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
truth, and preserve them uninjured during the rapid
encroachments of gross ignorance under the mask of
scientific knowledge."</p>

<p>Faraday's high position in the world of science and
his well-known thoroughness in investigating any subject
in which he interested himself, made his utterances
on the subject of spirit-rapping and table-turning
convincing to a large number of people. He was, however,
for many years occasionally pestered with questions
about it, by persons who thought they could prove to
him that he was wrong; perhaps in no matter did
Faraday so nearly lose his patience as over this; at no
other time did he so nearly exhibit that volcano of fiery
passion which, according to Tyndall, underlay the sweetness
and gentleness of disposition which were his
ever-obvious qualities. He had, as Tyndall well puts it,
"through high self-discipline converted the fire into a
central glow and motive power of life, instead of permitting
it to waste itself in useless passion. 'He that is
slow to anger,' saith the sage, 'is greater than the mighty,
and he that ruleth his own spirit than he that taketh a
city!' Faraday was <em>not</em> slow to anger, but he completely
ruled his own spirit; and thus, though he took
no cities, he captivated all hearts."</p>

<p>Miss Barnard, from her long and intimate acquaintance
with her uncle, quite endorses what Professor
Tyndall says. She says that a most fiery passion was
kept under by the most perfect master, and during all
the years she knew him she could not recollect above
two occasions when Faraday, even for a moment, let
his passion get the better of him.</p>

<p>Lightly as he looked upon honours such as are the
ones usually appreciated by more worldly men, Faraday
was always well-pleased and more than gratified when
recognised by leading men of science or literature.
Many as were the distinctions which had been and were
still being heaped upon him, he would especially value
such a one as was offered him in 1854, when one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in a measure had been his pupil&mdash;Henry Mayhew&mdash;dedicated
to him a volume on the <cite>Wonders of Science</cite>,
illustrating the life and progress in scientific knowledge
of young Humphry Davy. This dedication runs, "My
dear sir, I inscribe your name on one of the fly-leaves
of this little book, with the same devotion as youths
are wont to carve upon the trunk of some forest tree
the name of those whom they admire most in the
world; and I do so for many reasons." And in
concluding the dedication he shows us once more the
helpfulness and goodness of Faraday's nature: "And
now, my dear sir, let me, in conclusion, thank you for
your generous encouragement of my labours when I
was engaged in inquiring into the condition of the
'London Poor.' Many know your wisdom, but none
are better acquainted with your goodness than yours
very truly,
</p>

<p class="marginright">"<span class="smcap">Henry Mayhew.</span>"</p>

<p>Never, when a success beyond the wildest imaginings
of his youth had crowned his devotion to science, did
Faraday forget the time of his early struggles, and the
humble beginning which he had made. As we have
before mentioned, he would frequently stop in the street
to speak a kindly word of encouragement to young
newspaper lads who were just starting in life in the way
that he had done over half a century earlier. An incident
such as that depicted in the illustration was, indeed,
a not uncommon one, for, to refer again to the Professor's
own words, he could not but feel a tenderness for such
boys, because he had once carried newspapers himself.</p>

<div class="caption">FARADAY AND THE NEWSBOY.</div>
</div>

<p>In Miss Reid's recollections of her illustrious uncle,
from which we have quoted in an earlier chapter, there
was something said about the reading which interested
the scientist in his hours of relaxation. This is always
an interesting matter in connection with our great men;
we are always glad to know what they read, and, if possible,
why they read it. At a party about this time,
Faraday joined in a discussion which was being
carried on on the subject of novel reading, and some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of those present took a few notes of such works as he
mentioned as being specially interesting or entertaining
to him. He liked novels, he said, with some stir and
life in them, such as <cite>Paul Ferrol</cite>, <cite>Jane Eyre</cite>, too&mdash;although
of this he characteristically said, "there's a
touch of mesmerism and mystery at the end which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
would be better away." Of Scott's novels he was
always a great admirer, liking particularly <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>, <cite>Guy
Mannering</cite>, and <cite>Waverley</cite>; he also spoke admiringly of
Fanny Burney's novel, <cite>Evelina</cite>, a book that is hardly
among the generally read novels of to-day. Writing in
1858 to Professor de la Rive on the death of Mrs.
Marcet,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Faraday mentions his early reading as follows:
"Do not suppose that I was a very deep thinker, or was
marked as a precocious person, I could believe in the
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> as easily as in the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite>. But
facts were important to me and saved me. I could trust
a fact, and always cross-examined an assertion. So
when I questioned Mrs. Marcet's book by such little
experiments as I could find means to perform, and found
it true to the facts as I could understand them, I felt
that I had got hold of an anchor in chemical knowledge,
and clung fast to it. Thence my deep veneration for
Mrs. Marcet."</p>

<p>When, in 1857, Mr. Cyrus Field was in England preparing
for the laying of the great telegraph cable across
the Atlantic Ocean, he inquired of Faraday as to what
he thought of its practicability; the philosopher doubted
the possibility of transmitting a message. Field saw
that an objection from so great an authority would prove
well-nigh fatal, and that it must be removed at once;
he therefore offered to pay Faraday sufficiently for his
services if he would undertake such experiments as
were necessary. Faraday declined the money, but
undertook the experiments, and on their completion
reported to Field, "It can be done, but you will not
get an instantaneous message."</p>

<p>"How long will it take?" anxiously inquired the
engineer.</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps a second."</p>

<p>"Well, that's quick enough for me."</p>

<p>The year 1858 is an interesting one in the life of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Michael Faraday; for over forty years he had lived in
the Royal Institution, and during that time had risen
from being a journeyman bookbinder with a small circle
of friends, to being the first of living philosophers, with
a fame known all over the world, and with friends
wherever his fame had penetrated. In this year, however,
while still retaining his connection with the Royal
Institution, he removed with his wife to a house at
Hampton Court, which had been kindly placed at their
disposal by Her Majesty the Queen, at the instigation of
the Prince Consort. Faraday writes in April to Prince
Albert's secretary acknowledging the extreme kindness
of Her Majesty, but expressing himself as doubtful
whether to accept or to decline. The house it appeared
wanted some repairs which Faraday felt doubtful about;
he did not feel that he would be enabled to undertake
them, but his mind was soon set at rest on this score,
for in the summer of this year, writing to one of his
nieces, he says, "The case is settled. The Queen has
desired me to dismiss all thoughts of the repairs, as the
house is to be put into thorough repair both inside and
out. The letter from Sir C. Phipps is most kind." In
writing to Sir C. Phipps himself Faraday said, "I find
it difficult to write my thanks or express my sense of the
gratitude I owe to Her Majesty; first, for the extreme
kindness which is offered to me in the use of the house
at Hampton Court, but far more for that condescension
and consideration which, in respect of personal rest and
health, was the moving cause of the offer. I feared
that I might not be able properly to accept Her Majesty's
most gracious favour. I would not bring myself to decline
so honourable an offer, and yet I was constrained
carefully to consider whether its acceptance was consistent
with my own particular and peculiar circumstances.
The enlargement of Her Majesty's favour has
removed all difficulty. I accept with deep gratitude, and
I hope that you will help me to express fitly to Her
Majesty my thanks and feelings on this occasion."</p>

<div class="caption">FARADAY'S HOUSE, HAMPTON COURT GREEN.</div>
</div>

<p>Faraday's house, standing pleasantly on Hampton
Court Green, was, as will be seen from the illustration,
a delightful creeper-embowered place, and with its open
aspect and surrounding greenery, must have afforded a
great and agreeable change to the tired philosopher and
his wife. For some years after his removal Faraday
made frequent runs up to town to the Institution,
where he continued his research work and also delivered
many lectures, notably, several courses of the
now annual Juvenile Lectures. He was, however, not
able to continue for long spells of work, but had to
take occasional intervals of rest. He still made frequent
reports in connection with Trinity House, but refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to take up any further work. He declined even
to prepare his Juvenile Lectures for publication, although
other reasons than his own incapacity for
sustained work here influenced him, as we see by the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Royal Institution, January 3, 1859.<br />
</p>

<p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;Many thanks both to you and Mr.
Bentley. Mr. Murray made me an unlimited offer like
that of Mr. Bentley's many years ago, but for the
reasons I am about to give you I had to refuse his
kindness. He proposed to take them by shorthand,
and so save me trouble, but I knew that would be a
thorough failure; even if I cared to give time to the
revision of the MS., still the lectures without the experiments
and the vivacity of speaking would fall far
behind those in the lecture room as to effect. And
then I do not desire to give time to them, for money is
no temptation to me. In fact, I have always loved
science more than money; and because my occupation
is almost entirely personal, I cannot afford to get rich.</p>

<p>"Again thanking you and Mr. Bentley,</p>

<p class='center'><span class="ind55">"I remain, very truly yours,</span></p>
<p class="marginright">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have had to insist once or twice upon Faraday's
deeply religious nature; it comes out very clearly in
some letters written about this time, when he was an
old man&mdash;having very nearly attained to the threescore
years and ten of man's life. In his work and in
his conversation he never obtruded his religious convictions,
but the innate religious feeling of the man
coloured his every relation with his fellow men. In
that we have but few direct writings of his on this subject,
a grave interest attaches to the following letter to
his niece: "I never heard of the saying that separation
is the brother of death; I think that it does death
an injustice, at least in the mind of the Christian;
separation simply implies no re-union; death has to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Christian everything hoped for contained in the idea of
re-union. I cannot think that death has to the Christian
anything in it that should make it a rare, or other than
a constant thought; out of the view of death comes
the view of the life beyond the grave, as out of the
view of sin (that true and real view which the Holy
Spirit alone can give to a man) comes the glorious hope;
without the conviction of sin there is no ground of hope
to the Christian. As far as he is permitted for the
trial of his faith to forget the conviction of sin, he
forgets his hope, he forgets the need of Him who became
sin or a sin-offering for His people, and overcame
death by dying. And though death be repugnant to
the flesh, yet where the Spirit is given, to die is gain.
What a wonderful transition it is! for, as the apostle
says, even whilst having the firstfruits of the Spirit,
the people of God groan within themselves, 'waiting
for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body.'
Elsewhere he says, that whilst in the earthly house of
this tabernacle we groan, earnestly desiring to be
clothed upon with our house which is from heaven.</p>

<p>"It is permitted to the Christian to think of death;
he is even represented as praying that God would teach
him to number his days. Words are given to him,
'O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory?' and the answer is given him, 'Thanks be
to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ.' And though the thought of death brings
the thought of judgment, which is far above all the
trouble that arises from the breaking of mere earthly
ties, it also brings to the Christian the thought of Him
who died, was judged, and who rose again for the
justification of those who believe in Him. Though the
fear of death be a great thought, the hope of eternal
life is a far greater.... You see I chat now and then
with you as if my thoughts were running openly before
us on the paper, and so it is. My worldly faculties are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
slipping away day by day. Happy is it for all of us that the true
good lies not in them. As they ebb, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
they leave us as little children, trusting in the Father
of mercies and accepting His unspeakable gift."</p>

<p>In 1860 Faraday became once more an elder in the
Sandemanian Church, and retained that office for nearly
four years, when he finally resigned it. The meeting of
the British Association was held in this year at Oxford,
and Faraday was once more present, as he liked to be, at
this scientific gathering. A friend, apropos of this visit,
wrote the following <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</i>, which is worth remembering&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent17">"'That P will change to F in the British tongue is true</div>

<div class="caption">FARADAY DELIVERING HIS CHRISTMAS JUVENILE LECTURES.</div>
</div>

<p>This same year is also notable as being the nineteenth,
and last, in which Faraday delivered the Christmas
Juvenile Lectures; for ten years in succession he had
given them, the four lectures of this, his final course,
being those well known and generally appreciated ones
upon "The Chemical History of a Candle." An
earlier course having been given some years before
on the same subject. His failing health and memory
made it necessary for him to discontinue much of his
work, and in the following year his last experimental
work was done, and (on June 20) his last Friday
evening lecture delivered. A touching and pathetic
interest attaches to the slight notes which he made
for this, his last lecture. The notes are brief&mdash;but yet
how much is there not expressed in them?</p>

<p>"Personal explanation&mdash;years of happiness here, but
time of retirement; <span class="smcap">LOSS OF MEMORY</span> and <em>physical
endurance of the brain</em>.</p>

<p>"1. Causes&mdash;<em>hesitation and uncertainty</em> of the convictions
which the speaker has to urge.</p>

<p>"2. <em>Inability to draw</em> upon the mind for the treasures
of knowledge it has previously received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"3. <em>Dimness</em>, and forgetfulness of one's former <em>self-standard</em>
in respect of <em>right</em>, <em>dignity</em>, and <em>self-respect</em>.</p>

<p>"4. Strong duty of <em>doing justice to others</em>, yet inability
to do so.</p>

<p>"<em>Retire.</em>"</p>

<p>Thus did the old man of seventy years touchingly bid
farewell to work which he had been carrying on for the
greater part of half a century&mdash;to that work which had
received from him the untiring devotion of a life-time.
In 1862 his memory, which had previously troubled him,
became even less trustworthy; though his cheerfulness,
faith, and innate optimism were never clouded for a
moment, as is well-shown in a letter which he wrote to
the wife of his old friend Barlow. "I called at your
house," Faraday wrote, "and I rejoice to think that your
absence is a sign of good health. <em>Our love to you both.</em> I
am enjoying the gradual decay of strength and life, for
when I revive it is no great revival or desire to me, and
that cheers me in the view of death near and round us."</p>

<p>In 1863 his chief work was in connection with the
Trinity House, Faraday continuing to report upon the
value of the magneto-electric light for lighthouses, and
visiting yet again, as he had frequently done for years
past, Dungeness and other stations for the purpose.
Despite his incapacity for sustained mental work owing
to his failing memory, Faraday continued fairly hale in
body, and was yet active, for in February of 1863 he was
at Dungeness, and in the autumn of the same year he was
in Scotland for a fortnight, and wrote from Glasgow to
one who for over forty years had been his loving
companion, a letter breathing an affection unaltered by
the lapse of years, unless indeed it were, to use his own
expression, that it had grown <em>deeper</em>. We have seen the
letters which he wrote in the early years of his marriage;
it is fitting that we should quote from this one to show
how unchanged he was, despite the many years which
had passed over him. "I long to see you, dearest," he
wrote, "and to talk over things together, and call to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
mind all the kindness I have received. My head is full
and my heart also, but my recollection rapidly fails, even
as regards the friends that are in the room with me.
You will have to resume your old function of being a
pillow to my mind, and a rest, a happy-making wife....
Dearest, I long to see and be with you. Whether
together or separate, your husband, very affectionate,</p>

<p class="marginright">
"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday.</span>"</p>

<p>In 1865 he felt compelled to relinquish the active work
in connection with the Trinity House, without altogether
retiring from his position, for after thirty years' work,
during which he had been treated by the Brethren with
uniform kindness and consideration, he did not like to
altogether sever his connection with friends with whom
he had been so long and so harmoniously working.
In accordance with Faraday's wishes Professor Tyndall
undertook this work for him. In the same year he felt
it necessary to communicate with the managers of the
Royal Institution, expressing his desire to be allowed,
without severing his connection with it, to give up his
active work for the Institution.</p>

<p>The last two years of his life were thus passed "waiting"
as he once or twice expressed it. To an old friend of
very many years' standing he had said, "Barlow, you
and I are waiting&mdash;that is what we have to do now;
and we must try to do it patiently." And again, in reply
to a friend who inquired as to how he was, he simply
replied, "Just waiting." Thus gradually and quietly the
end approached. One of his nieces writes of her annual
visit in 1867:</p>

<p>"I spent June at Hampton Court. Dear uncle kept
up rather better than sometimes; but oh! there was
always pain in seeing afresh how far the mind had faded
away. Still the sweet unselfish disposition was there,
winning the love of all around him....</p>

<p>"I shall never look at the lightning flashes without
recalling his delight in a beautiful storm. How he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
would stand at the window for hours, watching the
effects and enjoying the scene; while we knew his mind
was full of lofty thoughts; sometimes of the great
Creator, and sometimes of the laws by which He sees
meet to govern the earth.</p>

<p>"I shall also always connect the sight of the hues of
a brilliant sunset with him, and especially he will be
present to my mind while I watch the fading of the
tints into the sombre grey of night. He loved to have
us with him, as he stood or sauntered on some open spot,
and spoke his thoughts, perhaps in the words of Gray's
Elegy, which he retained in memory, clearly, long after
many other things had faded quite away. Then, as
darkness stole on, his companions would gradually turn
indoors, while he was well pleased to be left to solitary
communings with his own thoughts."</p>

<p>On the 25th of August, 1867, he passed quietly away,
dying in his chair in his study at Hampton Court. His
niece, Miss Barnard, from whose recollections we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
learned much in earlier chapters, had spent a good
part of her life with her aunt and uncle, and had helped
to nurse the latter during the last few months. "My
occupation has gone," she pathetically wrote to Dr.
Bence Jones. On August 30th, the funeral took place,
everything being conducted simply and quietly; it was,
as Faraday had himself expressed a desire that it should
be, strictly private. A plain headstone in Highgate
Cemetery, with the following simple inscription,
marks the place where lies all that was mortal of
one of England's noblest sons.</p>

<p>If it were necessary to add anything to these simple
words that mark his resting-place, there might be put,
and it would apply to Faraday as truly as to any man
that ever lived, the well-known line&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>At various periods of Faraday's life his genial good-nature
and kindliness have been brought home to
us in different ways. From that early time when he
used to take care of his little sister Margaret in Manchester
Square, up to the very latest course of Juvenile
Lectures which he delivered at the Royal Institution in
1863, he had always the same love for young people;
and, as is usual with persons of such a disposition, he
was ever a great favourite of the children, whether of
those who used to hear his Christmas lectures, or with
those happier ones who met him more intimately.
Intimate seems perhaps a curious word to use with
regard to the relations of young children and an old
man; but yet it is the only word that really expresses
what is meant; that really indicates that instant bond
of sympathy that seems to connect children with men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and women who possess the power of attracting and
delighting them by becoming from the first as one of
themselves. This quality, this delightful quality, belonged
to Michael Faraday in an eminent degree.</p>

<p>Fortunate indeed were those children who listened to
his Christmas Lectures to Juveniles, and fortunate also
were those older people who were present on the same
occasions. Many people who enjoyed the pleasure and
privilege of hearing him at such a time recorded their
impressions, and pleasant reading is the result. Lady
Pollock, for instance, wrote: "When he lectured to
children he was careful to be perfectly distinct, and
never allowed his ideas to outrun their intelligence. He
took great delight in talking to them, and easily won
their confidence. The vivacity of his manner and of
his countenance, his pleasant laugh, the frankness of his
whole bearing, attracted them to him. They felt as if
he belonged to them; and indeed he sometimes, in his
joyous enthusiasm, appeared like an inspired child. He
was not at all a man for evening parties; he was
nothing of a ladies' man; but he was the true man for
the juveniles, and would go to see a domestic charade
when the boys acted in it, and suddenly appear behind
the scene to offer a little help or suggest a new arrangement;
and then, while he was in front, he would laugh
and applaud so loudly, that his presence was the best
encouragement which the young performers could have.
Or he would help the young people to wonder at the
feats of a conjuror, or he would join in a round game,
and romp quite noisily. But all was done with a
natural impulse. There was no assumption of kindness,
no air of condescension."</p>

<p>Another writer, who had the rare privilege of meeting
the great man socially, said: "Nothing indeed pleased
him better than to be a boy again, and to mingle in the
sports of the young, especially if they took a turn congenial
at all to his own pursuits. He has been known
to join a youthful party on a November evening to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
assist in a display of fireworks. There he might be
seen running to and fro in a garden at night, with
his pockets crammed with combustibles&mdash;now kindling
lycopodium or burning potassium&mdash;then letting off blue
fires, green fires, purple fires&mdash;sometimes dropping
ignited crackers at the feet of the boys with an air of
affected astonishment, or probably chasing the girls in
order to streak their cheeks with phosphorus."</p>

<p>As a lecturer to children Faraday was indeed particularly
successful and especially interesting. His first
course of Christmas Juvenile Lectures was given in
1827&mdash;his last, on "The Chemical History of a Candle,"
was given in 1863, and during that time he gave in all
nineteen of these courses. The first consisted of six
lectures on chemistry, and the first lecture of the course
was illustrated with no fewer than eighty-six experiments,
which were, it is scarcely necessary to say, carried
out on the platform. In his note-book Faraday made
the following entry with regard to this course, "The six
juvenile lectures were just what they ought to have
been, both in matter and manner; but it would not
answer to give an extended course in the same spirit."</p>

<p>One secret of Faraday's success as a lecturer, both
to juveniles and others, was the carefulness with which
he always tried to ascertain what was the best method.
In early years he would have a friend (Magrath, or
some other) among the audience, who was to tell him
afterwards of any peculiarities, either of manner or
style, that wanted correcting; and Miss Reid tells us
that in the early years of the Juvenile Lectures her
uncle used to encourage her to tell him everything that
struck her; and, when she did not fully understand
him, where her difficulties lay. He would then enlarge
upon those points in the next lecture, and thus he made
a child's remark serve him in making things clear to
children. He used also, at first, to have a card, on which
was distinctly written the word <em>Slow</em>, before him; and if
he forgot it and became rapid, his assistant Anderson had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
orders to place it before him. Sometimes also when his
lecture hour was nearly expired, he would arrange to have
a card with the word <em>Time</em> on it, placed within his view.</p>

<p>One of his early courses for children treated of that
subject which always possessed a great fascination for
him, and in which he did much of his greatest work&mdash;electricity.
The slight notes which he made for the
first lecture of this course are interesting. "An extraordinary
power that I have to explain; not fear boldly
entering into its consideration, because I think it ought
to be understood by children&mdash;not minutely, but so as
to think reasonably about it, and such effects as children
can produce, or observe to take place in nature&mdash;simple
instances of its power." This first lecture was illustrated
by eighty experiments.</p>

<p>We have dwelt upon his kindliness and sympathy with
children; but, it may be noted, he had none of his own,
though from almost the earliest year of his married life
he always liked to have one or other of his nieces with
him. His love for children is well shown in an anecdote
which Dr. Gladstone tells of his later life. He was at
a soirée at the house of Mr. Justice Grove; the eldest
daughter having heard him express himself disappointed
at being too late to see any of the younger members of
the family, brought down the little ones in their nightgowns
to the foot of the stairs, when Faraday showed
how gratified he was by saying to her, "Ah! that's the
best thing you've done to-night."</p>

<p>Sometimes he would indulge in some slight practical
jokes with the young people. For instance, a nephew
visiting him in his study one morning, Faraday said to him,
"Why, Frank, what a tall boy you are growing; you can
almost touch that brass ball&mdash;just try." Nothing loth,
the boy standing on tiptoe reached up and touched the
ball with his fingers, when his playful uncle gave a turn
to a wheel and the boy received a slight shock, and with
it a first, and somewhat unexpected, lesson on the nature
of electricity.</p>

<p>The Prince Consort was a constant patron of the
Royal Institution, and the young princes also were
present at many of the Juvenile Lectures. After attending
such a course H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, then a
lad of fifteen, and his brother, H.R.H. Prince Alfred,
Duke of Edinburgh, wrote from Windsor Castle the
following letters to Professor Faraday:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;I am anxious to thank you for the advantage
I have derived from attending your most interesting
lectures. Their subject, I know very well, is of great
importance, and I hope to follow the advice you gave
us of pursuing it beyond the lecture-room; and I can
assure you that I shall always cherish with great
pleasure the recollection of having been assisted in
my early studies in chemistry by so distinguished a man.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="ind55">"Believe me, dear Sir, yours truly,</span></p>
<p class="marginright">"<span class="smcap">Albert Edward.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prince Alfred's letter was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;I write to thank you very much for the
pleasure you have given me by your lectures, and I
cannot help hoping they will not be the last I shall hear
from you. Their subject was very interesting, and your
clear explanations made it doubly so.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="ind55">"Believe me, dear Sir, yours truly,</span></p>
<p class="marginright">"<span class="smcap">Alfred.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to learn Faraday's own views with
regard to popular lectures, for never yet was there a
truly scientific lecturer who was more truly popular;
perhaps, indeed, there is no other single man who,
without in any degree lowering his work for the purpose,
succeeded so well in popularising scientific knowledge.
These are his own words on the subject: "As
to popular lectures (which at the same time are to be
<em>respectable</em> and <em>sound</em>) none are more difficult to find.
Lectures which <em>really teach</em> will never be popular; lectures
which are popular will never <em>really teach</em>." His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
own success as a lecturer was owing largely to the
power he had of adapting himself to all minds, from
the deepest thinkers to the liveliest youth; this power
gave him a "wide range of influence, and his sympathy
with the young among his listeners imparted more life
and colour to his discourses than they might otherwise
have possessed. He had the art of making philosophy
charming, and this was due in no little measure to the
fact that to grey-headed wisdom, he united wonderful
juvenility of spirit."</p>

<p>"He was," to quote once more from Lady Pollock's
recollections of the illustrious lecturer, "completely
master of the situation; he had his audience at his
command, as he had himself and all his belongings; he
had nothing to fret him, and he could give his eloquence
full sway. It was an irresistible eloquence, which
compelled attention and insisted upon sympathy. It
waked the young from their visions and the old from
their dreams. There was a gleaming in his eye which
no painter could copy, and which no poet could describe....
His enthusiasm sometimes carried him to the
point of ecstasy when he expatiated on the beauty of
nature, and when he lifted the veil from her deep
mysteries. His body then took motion from his mind;
his hair streamed out from his head, his hands were
full of nervous action, his light, lithe body seemed to
quiver with its eager life. His audience took fire with
him, and every face was flushed.... A pleasant vein
of humour accompanied his ardent imagination, and
occasionally, not too often, relieved the tension of
thought imposed upon his pupils. He would play with
his subject now and then, but very delicately; his sport
was only just enough to enliven the effort of attention.
He never suffered an experiment to allure him away
from his theme. Every touch of his hand was a true
illustration of his argument." As he once remarked
in giving advice to a young lecturer: "If I said to
my audience, 'This stone will fall to the ground if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
open my hand,' I should open my hand and let it fall.
Take nothing for granted as known; inform the eye at
the same time as you address the ear."</p>

<p>It is of interest here&mdash;after seeing how Faraday as
a lecturer impressed others&mdash;to note some of the remarks
which he made on the subject of lectures, lecturers,
and lecturing in his early correspondence with
his friend, Benjamin Abbott. Several long letters on
this matter passed between the friends, and Faraday
(he was twenty-one at the time) not only speaks in a
discriminating manner with regard to lectures, but he
also treats with his native good sense of lecture rooms,
apparatus, etc. All his remarks, he says in his earliest
letter to Abbott on the subject, are the result of his own
personal observation. The most necessary quality for a
lecturer, says the youthful Faraday, is a good delivery;
he then dwells upon the necessity of illustrating a lecture
with experiments wherever possible. (How well
he carried this rule into practice has been seen in an
earlier part of this chapter, where we learned of some
of his Juvenile Lectures being illustrated by upwards of
eighty experiments.) "A lecturer," he goes on to say,
"should appear easy and collected, undaunted and
unconcerned,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> his thoughts about him, and his mind
clear and free for the contemplation and description of
his subject." He then says, and we instantly think of
the "time" card he had placed before him later, "I
disapprove of long lectures; one hour is long enough
for anyone, nor should they be allowed to exceed that
time."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p>The last of this series of letters on lectures commences
in a style of genial banter, which, as it illustrates
the lighter side of Faraday's character, merits quotation.
"Dear Abbott," he writes, "As when on some secluded
branch in forest far and wide sits perched an owl, who,
full of self-conceit and self-created wisdom, explains,
comments, condemns, ordains, and orders things not
understood, yet full of his importance still holds forth
to stocks and stones around&mdash;so sits and scribbles Mike;
so he declaims to walls, stones, tables, chairs, hats, books,
pens, shoes, and all the things inert that be around him,
and so he will to the end of the chapter."</p>

<p>This playful mood comes out, also, in one or two
anecdotes which are told of him, when his fame was
established. For instance, an old lady friend being
much troubled by some rancid butter, thought that she
had hit upon a method of improving it, which she did
by mixing with it a quantity of soda, she having a somewhat
high opinion of the purifying virtues of that alkali,
although, it is to be presumed, she little suspected the
uses to which it was applied in the manufactures. By
this addition of soda, she triumphantly claimed that her
butter "was greatly improved." One evening, when
Professor Faraday called upon her, the old lady produced
a sample of her "improved" butter. A merry
laugh rang out from the philosopher's lips as he exclaimed,
"Well done, Mrs. W., you have improved your
bad butter into very indifferent <em>soap</em>!"</p>

<p>Good-humoured and good-natured as Faraday habitually
was, he did not like to be worried unnecessarily
over unimportant matters; and willing as he was to
place even his invaluable time at the disposal of almost
anyone who claimed his attention, he had no patience
with persons who came to him thoughtlessly, as the
following story shows: A young man called on him
one morning, and with an air of great importance confided
to him the result of some original researches in
electrical philosophy. "And pray," asked the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
taking down a volume of Ree's <cite>Cyclop&oelig;dia</cite>, "did you
consult this, or any elementary work, to learn whether
your discovery had been anticipated?" The young man
replied in the negative. "Then why do you come to
waste my time about well-known facts that were published
forty years ago?" "Sir," said the visitor in
self-excuse, and hoping to flatter the philosopher, "I
thought I had better bring the matter to headquarters
immediately." "All very well for you, but not so well
for headquarters," replied the professor sharply, and he
forthwith set his visitor to read the article in the
<cite>Cyclop&oelig;dia</cite>.</p>

<p>Yet another story is told of a grave old gentleman
who once waited upon Faraday that he might show to
him "a new law of physics." The gentleman asked for
a jug of water and a tumbler; they were brought, and
he then produced a cork. "You will be pleased to
observe," he then said, "how persistently this cork
clings to the side of the glass when the vessel is half-filled."</p>

<p>"Just so," replied the professor.</p>

<p>"But now," continued the discoverer of a new law of
physics, "mark what happens when I fill the glass to
the brim. There! you see the cork flies to the centre&mdash;positively
repelled by the sides!"</p>

<p>"Precisely so," answered Faraday in an amused
tone, which showed that the "new law" was more
familiar to him than to his visitor, who, somewhat
abashed, said, "Pray, how long have you known this?"
"Oh, ever since I was a boy," was the reply; but the
innate kindliness of his nature must show itself even in
such a case, for, seeing the old gentleman's disappointed
look, he added that he was not to be grieved, he might
possibly some day alight upon something really new.</p>

<p>The last course of Faraday's Juvenile Lectures&mdash;on
"The Chemical History of a Candle"&mdash;has been referred
to once or twice. These lectures are indeed of very great
interest, not only in themselves as chemical illustrations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but as being part of Professor Faraday's best known
works, and the only juvenile lectures of his which are
obtainable in the form of a book. The way in which he
introduced his subject will show us how simple, and yet
how explicit he was in explaining to his young audience
the phenomena which he brought before them.</p>

<p>"I purpose," he said, to quote the beginning of the
initial lecture of the series of six, "in return for the
honour you do us by coming to see what are our
proceedings here, to bring before you in the course of
these lectures, the chemical history of a candle. I
have taken this subject on a former occasion, and were
it left to my own will, I should prefer to repeat it almost
every year&mdash;so abundant is the interest that attaches
itself to the subject, so wonderful are the varieties of
outlet which it offers into the various departments of
philosophy. There is not a law under which any part
of this universe is governed which does not come into
play, and is touched upon in these phenomena. There
is no better, there is no more open door by which you
can enter into the study of natural philosophy, than by
considering the physical phenomena of a candle. I trust,
therefore, I shall not disappoint you in choosing this for
my subject rather than any newer topic, which could
not be better, were it even so good.</p>

<p>"And before proceeding, let me say this also&mdash;that
though our subject be so great, and our intention that
of treating it honestly, seriously, and philosophically,
yet I mean to pass away from all those who are seniors
amongst us. I claim the privilege of speaking to
juveniles as a juvenile myself. I have done so on
former occasions&mdash;and, if you please, I shall do so
again. And though I stand here with the knowledge
of having the words I utter given to the world, yet that
shall not deter me from speaking in the same familiar
way to those whom I esteem nearest to me on this
occasion.</p>

<p>"And now, my boys and girls, I must first tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of what candles are made. Some are great curiosities.
I have here some bits of timber, branches of trees
particularly famous for their burning. And here you
see a piece of that very curious substance taken out of some
of the bogs in Ireland, called <em>candlewood</em>&mdash;a hard, strong,
excellent wood, evidently fitted for good work as a
resister of force, and yet withal burning so well that
where it is found they make splinters of it, and torches,
since it burns like a candle, and gives a very good light
indeed. And in this wood we have one of the most
beautiful illustrations of the general nature of a candle
that I can possibly give. The fuel provided, the means
of bringing that fuel to the place of chemical action, the
regular and gradual supply of air to that place of action&mdash;heat
and light&mdash;all produced by a little piece of wood
of this kind, forming, in fact, a natural candle.</p>

<p>"But we must speak of candles as they are in commerce.
Here are a couple of candles commonly called
dips. They are made of lengths of cotton cut off, hung
up by a loop, dipped into melted tallow, taken out again
and cooled, then re-dipped until there is an accumulation
of tallow round the cotton. In order that you may
have an idea of the various characters of these candles,
you see these which I hold in my hand&mdash;they are very
small and very curious. They are, or were, the candles
used by miners in coal mines. In olden times the
miner had to find his own candles; and it was supposed
that a small candle would not so soon set fire to the
fire-damp in the coal mines as a larger one; and for
that reason, as well as for economy's sake, he made
candles of this sort&mdash;twenty, thirty, forty, or sixty to
the pound. They have been replaced since then by the
steel-mill, and then by the Davy lamp, and other safety
lamps of various kinds. I have here a candle that was
taken out of the <em>Royal George</em>, it is said, by Colonel
Pasley. It has been sunk in the sea for many years,
subject to the action of salt water. It shows you how
well candles may be preserved; for though it is cracked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
about and broken a good deal, yet, when lighted, it goes
on burning regularly, and the tallow resumes its natural
condition as soon as it is fused."</p>

<p>We have not space to quote further from these
delightful lectures, which however, as I have said
earlier, can be got in a little volume by themselves.
These lectures were, as indeed were most of Faraday's
lectures, beautifully illustrated with a large number of
experiments.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when suffering much in health,
Faraday yet insisted upon taking his place at the lecture
table at the Royal Institution; for an obstruction of
voice, which was indeed too painfully apparent, he
apologised, saying that "in an engagement where the
contracting parties were one and many, the one ought
not on any slight ground to break his part of the
engagement with the many, and therefore, if the
audience would excuse his imperfect utterance he would
proceed." The audience murmured, and there were
cries of "Put off the lecture;" but Faraday begged
to be allowed to go on. A medical man rose and said
it would in his opinion be dangerous for the Professor
to proceed. Faraday still urged his desire to go on
with the lecture; he could not give people all the
trouble of coming there, having perhaps put off other
engagements, for nothing. On this, as by a single
impulse, the whole audience rose, and Faraday yielded
to the generally expressed desire to spare him the pain
and inconvenience of lecturing. After a fortnight's
rest he reappeared, and continued the broken course,
carrying it on later that his audience should not lose
any of the eight lectures which they had anticipated.
It was on a reappearance such as this after illness
that "as soon as his presence was recognised, the
whole audience rose simultaneously, and burst into a
spontaneous utterance of welcome, loud and long."</p>

<p>In treating of the life-story of Michael Faraday I have
let particulars as to his various experiments and discoveries
interfere as little as possible with the continuity
of the narrative, and have thought it advisable to slightly
refer to them in a special chapter. The value of his contributions
to our fund of scientific knowledge is made manifest
by the fact that whatever book on electricity and allied
subjects we may take up now&mdash;works even bringing the
science down to the very latest date&mdash;we always find the
name and experiments of Michael Faraday quoted with
great respect as a leader and an unquestioned authority.
Indeed, our debt to him for his electrical work is incalculable;
we are now seeing the electric light carried day
by day into more streets, lighting more public places,
nay, even being used in illuminating private buildings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
This light we owe, primarily, to Michael Faraday.
Writing nearly a quarter of a century ago Professor
Tyndall answers this question as to "What is the use of
it all?" thus explicitly and unhesitatingly&mdash;"As far as
electricity has been applied for medical purposes, it has
been almost exclusively Faraday's electricity. You
have noticed those lines of wire which cross the streets
of London. It is Faraday's currents that speed from
place to place through these wires. Approaching the
point of Dungeness the mariner sees an unusually
brilliant light, and from the noble <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">phares</i> of La Hève
the same light flashes across the sea. These are Faraday's
sparks exalted by suitable machinery to sunlike splendour.
At the present moment the Board of Trade and the
Brethren of the Trinity House, as well as the Commissioners
of Northern Lights, are contemplating the
introduction of the Magneto-electric Light at numerous
points upon our coasts; and future generations will be
able to refer to those guiding stars in answer to the
question, What has been the practical use of the labours
of Faraday? But I would again emphatically say that
his work needs no such justification; and that if he had
allowed his vision to be disturbed by considerations
regarding the practical use of his discoveries, those discoveries
would never have been made by him."</p>

<p>In one of his very earliest lectures delivered before
the City Philosophical Society on the subject of chlorine,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Faraday referred to the question too often and too
thoughtlessly put on hearing of a new discovery. "Before
leaving this subject," he said, "I will point out the
history of this substance, as an answer to those who are
in the habit of saying to every new fact, 'What is its
use?' Benjamin Franklin says to such, 'What is the
use of an infant?' The answer of the experimentalist
is, 'endeavour to make it useful.'" Truly the infant
Electricity has already grown to goodly proportions. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>is to his researches in connection with electrical science
that we must look for the chief result of Faraday's
work. His later years were almost exclusively taken
up in the investigation of this fascinating subject.</p>

<p>The value of his contributions to the sum of knowledge
on this new branch of science was testified to in
a remarkable manner during the past summer, when the
centenary of his birth was celebrated in a fitting manner
at that Institution which had been a "home" to him
for so many years. It was indeed an unique incident
in the history of modern science, when on the 17th of
June, 1891, many of the leading living scientists met in
the theatre of the Royal Institution to hear a lecture
by Lord Rayleigh on the life-work of "one of England's
greatest worthies." "A quarter of a century has not
elapsed," wrote a contemporary journal,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> "since his
death, and yet we find the highest nobles of the land
vieing with the most illustrious professors of our own
and of foreign universities in testifying their admiration
for this man of the people, who rose to be a leader of
scientific men." "When the history of electricity
comes to be written," continues the same authority, "a
chapter of great extent and first importance must be
given to the prolific life-work of Faraday. He will be
pointed to as the man who in the middle of the nineteenth
century, waged an energetic and relentless warfare
against the two fluid theories in electricity and magnetism,
and who dealt its death-blow to the theory of action at
a distance. And to show the powerful influence his
master-mind exercised over contemporary science, the
historian may merely refer to Clerk-Maxwell, Sir
William Thomson, Rayleigh, Tyndall, and others, all
admiring disciples and professed followers of the great
Michael Faraday."</p>

<p>The meeting that thus did honour to the memory of
Faraday, was probably the most fitting method of celebrating
the anniversary of his birth that could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>been devised; it was, we may feel sure, just such a
celebration as Faraday would have felt most proud of.
Wealth and social rank, as we have seen throughout his
life, had no attraction for him; but he <em>did</em> like to
receive the appreciation of capable men, in whose appreciation
he found the highest honour to which it was
possible to attain.</p>

<p>Some of Faraday's earliest experiments, as was
incidentally mentioned in an earlier part of this little
book, were in connection with chlorine, etc., and then
on the making of glass for optical purposes; and it was
not, indeed, until he had been at the Institution for
about eighteen years that he really entered with any
degree of success into his electrical research. Here it is
of interest to note a remark which he once made in this
connection to the effect that it requires twenty years of
work to make a <em>man</em> in physical science, the whole of
the previous period being one of <em>infancy</em>. Once, however,
he had reached this scientific manhood his work
was done with remarkable rapidity; he would, once on
the track, so to speak, of a discovery, mature it in a
space of time so short as to be nothing less than marvellous;
and one after another of his "experimental
researches" were carried out, completed, described, and
the resultant paper submitted to the Royal Society with
a rapidity, and at the same time with an accuracy which
has never been equalled. He was asked once what was
the secret of his success, and answered that the whole
secret might be told in three words, they were these
"Work&mdash;Finish&mdash;Publish." Perhaps the centre word
is the one on which Faraday would himself have lain
most stress&mdash;he was always careful to finish everything
before he announced it, which makes his almost unexceptional
accuracy, considering the rapidity with which
he worked, even more remarkable. It is, however, not
inaccurate to say that the results which he definitely
announced, were never found to be wrong; further
developments have of course taken place, but the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of a research as announced by him was never found to
be untrue, and has never had to be put aside.</p>

<p>He had said, in the early part of his scientific career,
"the thing that I am proudest of is that I have never
been found to be wrong." And after the death of his
friend, Professor A. de la Rive wrote, "I do not think
that Faraday has once been caught in a mistake; so
precise and conscientious was his mode of experimenting
and observing." Dr. Gladstone commenting upon this
says, "The extreme rarity of his mistakes, notwithstanding
the immense amount of his published researches,
is one of those marvels which can be appreciated only by
those who are in the habit of describing what they have
seen in the mist-land that lies beyond the boundaries of
previous knowledge."</p>

<p>The proper treatment of Faraday's discoveries could
of course only be undertaken by one who was himself a
scientist; the technicalities of the laboratory and the
lecture-theatre would be somewhat out of place in a book
such as this, which but aims at presenting in a popular
form the facts in connection with the life of one of the
greatest of England's scientists&mdash;one of the best of her
sons. It may, however, here be pointed out that to
those who would become acquainted with the details of
Faraday's scientific work, with particulars of his
numerous experiments, a delightful introduction has
been afforded by Professor Tyndall, who in his little
work on <cite>Faraday as a Discoverer</cite>, has summarised much
of the great man's work, and explains in a clear and
delightful manner much about the experiments which
were undertaken and the discoveries which were made
by his illustrious predecessor and friend. It is of interest
to notice here what discovery of Faraday it is which
Tyndall selects as the greatest&mdash;it is the discovery of
electro-magnetism, of which he says: "The beauty and
exactitude of the results of this investigation are extraordinary.
I cannot help thinking while I dwell upon
them, that this discovery of magneto-electricity is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
greatest experimental result ever obtained by an
investigator. It is the Mont Blanc of Faraday's own
achievements. He always worked at great elevations,
but a higher than this he never subsequently attained."</p>

<p>The following impromptu lines with reference to
Faraday's great discovery of magneto-electricity were
written by Herbert Mayo:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent17">"Around the magnet Faraday</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Was sure that Volta's lightnings play,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">But how to draw them from the wire?</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He drew a lesson from the heart.&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent17">'Tis when we meet, 'tis when we part,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Breaks forth th' electric fire."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of this same subject Tyndall wrote shortly after
Faraday's death:&mdash;"Seven and thirty years have passed
since the discovery of magneto-electricity; but, if we
except the <em>extra current</em>, until quite recently nothing of
moment was added to the subject. Faraday entertained
the opinion that the discoverer of a great law or principle
had a right to the 'spoils'&mdash;this was his term&mdash;arising
from its illustration; and guided by the principle he
had discovered, his wonderful mind, aided by his
wonderful ten fingers, overran in a single autumn this
vast domain, and hardly left behind him the shred of a
fact to be gathered by his successors."</p>

<p>This indeed is a quality which has been insisted upon
by all who have as fellow scientists treated of the work
which was done by Michael Faraday,&mdash;this quality, that
is, of completion, of thoroughness in finishing that which
he had commenced; he seemed to become aware almost
as though by intuition of the full meaning of a discovery,
and of its true bearing with regard to previous
knowledge.</p>

<p>Great as was Faraday's work in the service of science
he not only did not aim at, but he frequently declined to
accept what many men would have considered but just
reward. He was a chemist, a scientist, a philosopher
(to give him the name which he best liked, and of which
he felt most proud), and did his work as such from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
purest love for it, as I have tried to show in earlier
chapters. He did not seek worldly position&mdash;he was
above it; he did not seek for wealth, he had no use for
it, as his wants were of the simplest; he did not seek for
popular applause, for the suffrage of the multitude; but
what he did all his life long most earnestly and most
faithfully strive for was&mdash;Truth. He ever aimed at
fulfilling what the Laureate has beautifully expressed in
his dedication to <cite>In Memoriam</cite> wherein he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent17">"Let knowledge grow from more to more,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">And more of reverence in us dwell,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">That mind and soul according well</div>
<div class="verse indent2">May make one music as before,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">But vaster."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He sought to make knowledge grow from more to more,
but it is to be recollected that he never for one more
moment swerved from his faithful adherence to his
Church. In all his research among physical phenomena
he was never led to doubt, as some have done, the truth
of that religion in which he always maintained a sincere
and beautiful faith; his religion was, indeed, always a
something far above his science, a something sacred and
of moment to himself, as a single soul. We saw in his
reply to his wife on his formally entering the Sandemanian
Church shortly after his marriage, what was
his attitude on this question. It was, as he had said, a
matter between himself and his God; and thus we find
in what he has written but very little about his religion,
although one or two of his letters to relations, where he
has been directly appealed to, breathe the sincere and
earnest devotion of the man, and his true Christian
spirit. His whole life was, however, a practical expression
of his religious faith; as is shown to us by what
has been said or written by all who came in contact
with him.</p>

<p>The following tribute to his memory from Monsieur
Dumas is yet one further proof of the universal feeling
which his friendship inspired, "I do not know whether
there is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> who would not feel happy in leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
behind him such works as those with which Faraday
has gladdened his contemporaries, and which he has
left as a legacy to posterity; but I am certain that all
those who have known him would wish to approach that
moral perfection which he attained to without effort.
In him it appeared to be a natural grace, which made
him a professor, full of ardour for the diffusion of truth,
an indefatigable worker, full of enthusiasm and sprightliness
in his laboratory, the best and most amiable of
men in the bosom of his family, and the most enlightened
preacher among the humble flock whose faith
he followed.</p>

<p>"The simplicity of his heart, his candour, his ardent
love of the truth, his fellow interest in all the successes,
and ingenuous admiration of all the discoveries of others,
his natural modesty in regard to what he himself
discovered, his noble soul&mdash;independent and bold&mdash;all
these combined gave an incomparable charm to the
illustrious physicist.</p>

<p>"I have never known a man more worthy of being
loved,&mdash;of being admired,&mdash;of being mourned. Fidelity
to his religious faith, and the constant observance of the
moral law, constitute the ruling characteristics of his
life.... There is more than one useful lesson to be
learnt from the proper study of this illustrious man,
whose youth endured poverty with dignity, whose
mature age bore honours with moderation, and whose
last years passed gently away surrounded by marks of
respect and tender affection."</p>

<p>Several stories are told that illustrate the constant
habit of experimenting which seemed to be innate in
Faraday's mind, and also show how simple were the
means which he often adopted to attain a required end.
An example of the latter is given us by Sir Frederick
Arrow in describing a visit which he, as one of the
Committee of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House,
paid, to observe the Dungeness electric light, in June
1862. The committee accompanied Faraday, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
always been a most energetic worker in the cause of
the Trinity House.</p>

<p>"We dined," says Sir Frederick Arrow, "I think at
Dover, and embarked in the yacht from there, and were
out for some hours watching it, to Faraday's great
delight&mdash;(a very fine night)&mdash;and especially we did so
from the Varne lightship about equi-distant between it
and the French light of Grisnez, using all our best
glasses and photometers to ascertain the relative value
of the lights; and this brings me to my story. Before
we left Dover, Faraday, with his usual bright smile, in
great glee showed me a little common paper-box, and
said, 'I must take care of this; it's my special photometer,'&mdash;and
then, opening it, produced a lady's
ordinary black shawl pin&mdash;jet, or imitation perhaps&mdash;and
then, holding it a little way off the candle, showed
me the image very distinct; and then putting it a
little further off, placed another candle near it, and the
relative distance was shown by the size of the image.
He lent me this afterwards when we were at the Varne
lightship, and it acted admirably; ever since I have
used one as a very convenient mode of observing, and I
never do so but I think of that night and dear good
Faraday, and his genial happy way of showing how
even common things may be made useful."</p>

<p>Such men as had occasion to work in the laboratory
with Faraday, were always struck by his lively enthusiasm,
and the great activity with which he worked&mdash;"his
motions were wonderfully rapid; and if he had to cross
the laboratory for anything, he did not walk at an
ordinary step but ran for it, and when he wanted anything
he spoke quickly."</p>

<p>In his methods of working he was most exact. Having
carefully planned out in his own mind work to be done,
he would enter the laboratory, and with his table
unencumbered with anything beyond such things as he
was using, would set to work in a grave, silent manner.
After a time, however, as the experiment proceeded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the result which he had anticipated began to manifest
itself, he would begin humming a tune, and even speak
to his attendant of the expected result. On finishing
such experimental work for the day, everything had to
be put carefully away, all bottles stoppered, open vessels
covered over, all instruments and materials returned to
their various drawers, all rubbish cleared from the floor,
and the laboratory left ready for the Professor to start
work again. Faraday would then go upstairs to his
study, and think further on the subject on which he
happened to be working.</p>

<p>In his later years we are told that he invariably
carried about with him convenient sized cards on which
he could jot down at once&mdash;in the street, in the lecture
room, at a friend's, indeed anywhere&mdash;such thoughts as
should flash across his mind.</p>

<p>A few words deserve to be said with regard to
Sergeant Anderson, who for over thirty years acted as
Faraday's laboratory assistant at the Royal Institution.
In 1829, when Faraday was working at experiments on
the manufacture of glass for optical purposes, a special
furnace was erected at the Royal Institution, and
Anderson was engaged to assist at it. After the glass
experiments were over, however, Anderson, who had
demonstrated his usefulness, was retained, and he
continued throughout the rest of Faraday's life as his
assistant, having won the good opinion not only of the
Professor but of all with whom he had anything to do.
There is one good story told of Anderson, who had been
chosen for his post on account of the habits of strict
obedience, which his military training had given him.
His duty was to keep the furnaces always at the same
heat, and the water in the ashpit always at the same
level. In the evening he was released; but one night
Faraday forgot to tell Anderson he could go, and early
next morning he found his faithful servant still stoking
the glowing furnace, as he had been doing all night
long.</p>

<p>The Royal Institution, which for so many years was
"home" to Michael Faraday, must ever remain
intimately associated with his name. It is not a hundred
years since it was founded, yet its history is the history
of Sir Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday, and John
Tyndall&mdash;or perhaps it would be more correct to say
that its history is in a large measure a history of
experimental research during the century. Before regarding
the Institution as it is especially connected
with the life-story of Michael Faraday, it may be well
to just glance at its origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the year 1799 a party of noblemen and
gentlemen met at the house of Sir Joseph Banks for
the purpose of forming themselves, at the suggestion of
Count Rumford, into a "Society for bettering the condition
of the poor." Count Rumford and his friends
were most anxious for the success of their undertaking;
and having once made a start did not remain idle, but
in January, 1800, succeeded in having their Society
incorporated by Royal Charter. The Society started
perhaps on a somewhat narrower basis than that on
which it now stands; its original object was that it
should be "an institution for diffusing the knowledge,
and facilitating the general introduction of useful
mechanical inventions and improvements; and for
teaching by courses of philosophical lectures and
experiments, the application of science to the common
purposes of life."</p>

<p>In a guide to London published in the early part of
the present century, No. 21, Albemarle Street is thus
referred to: "Here is also the Society's house for the
encouragement of improvements in arts and manufactures,
or the Royal Institution. The front of this house
is barricaded by double windows, to prevent the entrance
of cold in winter and heat in summer. Here is a room
for experimental dinners, and a kitchen fitted up on the
late Count Rumford's plan. Adjoining this is a large
workshop, in which a number of coppersmiths, braziers,
etc., are employed, and over this a large room for the
reception of such models of machinery as may be presented
to the Institution." It has been said that
chemistry dates one of its chief epochs from the foundation
of the Royal Institution laboratory.</p>

<p>The large building in Albemarle Street cannot be
mistaken, for there are along the front of it fourteen
great fluted Corinthian columns which give a striking
appearance to the premises. These columns were built
on to the face of the building in 1838, at a cost of five
hundred pounds, by Mr. Lewis Vulliamy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="600" height="505" alt="ROYAL INSTITUTION, ALBEMARLE STREET" />
<div class="caption"><em>From photo by</em>] ROYAL INSTITUTION, ALBEMARLE STREET. [<em>H. Dixon &amp; Son</em>.]</div>
</div>

<p>That the Royal Institution is, indeed, well worth
visiting it must be quite unnecessary to say. Even
was there not much to be seen which is of itself
interesting, the place would have an attraction as being
the place where so much has been done for the advancement
of science by Faraday, his predecessors, Davy,
Rumford, and Brande, and by Tyndall, and other
successors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_152.jpg" width="600" height="535" alt="LECTURE-THEATRE, ROYAL INSTITUTION" />
<div class="caption"><em>From photo by</em>] LECTURE-THEATRE, ROYAL INSTITUTION. [<em>H. Dixon &amp; Son</em>.</div>
</div>

<p>On entering the building we find ourselves in a lofty
hall; in front of us, at the head of a short flight of
stone steps, is a large portrait of Sir Humphry Davy,
while to the right we see Foley's fine and striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
statue of Faraday, which was placed there as being the
most fitting memorial of the great man's connection with
the Institution. On going up the flight of steps to the
right, we find ourselves in the well-appointed library,
where we are shown under a glass case a beautiful little
statuette of Faraday, and also a large photograph
portrait of the philosopher. We next visit the lecture-theatre,
our eyes being immediately drawn to the "seat
over the clock," where Michael Faraday as a boy first
sat, and listened and marvelled at the wonders of
chemistry unfolded before him by the great Humphry
Davy. This theatre it may be noted is one of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for its acoustic properties in London. Well may we
pause here&mdash;thinking of the great men who have
lectured here, and of the great men who have come
here to listen. It may be mentioned that the lectures
are not strictly confined to scientific subjects, for it was
here, in 1812, that Thomas Campbell gave his course of
lectures on poetry, and that another poet&mdash;Thomas
Moore&mdash;was also invited to lecture.</p>

<p>From the lecture-theatre we are taken downstairs to
see the room where all the numerous instruments and
materials are kept. Here we are shown the primitive
electrical machine, which Faraday early constructed for
himself, and many of the things which he used in his
work; here, too, we have pointed out to us a large glass-case
running along one side of the room, and divided
into sections, each section containing the tools and appliances
used by one or other of the great men of the
Institution, Davy and Brande and Faraday himself. In
several of the smaller rooms through which we are
permitted to pass, we notice among the many portraits
several of the subjects of this little work. And among
other interesting things especially pointed out to us there
is a locked glass-case "presented to the Royal Institution
by Michael and Sarah Faraday" (it was characteristic
of Faraday thus to put his wife in as one of the
donors). This case contains several books which
Michael had himself bound in those days when, disliking
trade, he was seeking to enter the service of science.
There are, besides, several books of Davy's and several
manuscripts of his also, which his assistant had carefully
kept.</p>

<p>And not only is the building worthy a visit on account
of the many interesting relics it contains of some of our
greatest scientists, and on account of the memoirs of its
many great men, but even to the unscientific there is
much that is attractive in the Friday Evening Lectures,
which since that year 1826, when Faraday may be said
to have inaugurated them, up to now, have been regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
carried on. No trouble is spared by the lecturers
to make their matter understood, and innumerable
experiments are presented on these occasions. The
experiments, too, are such as often require a great
expenditure of time and trouble in their preparation.
As an instance of this I may mention an experiment
which was made on the occasion of my latest attendance
at a "Friday evening." The lecturer was Professor
Harold Dixon; the subject of which he was treating was
"The Rate of Explosion of Gases." To show the
rapidity with which an explosion of a certain gas
travelled, the lecturer had fitted up a leaden piping all
round the theatre; the ends of the piping rested upon
either end of the table at which Professor Dixon was
lecturing. The piping was filled with gas, and the Professor
applied a light at one end; a sharp explosion
took place as the gas was fired, and was followed <em>almost
instantaneously</em> by an explosion at the other end of the
pipe&mdash;the explosion having in that very short time
travelled through a length of two hundred and twenty
feet of piping! I quote this instance to show that no
trouble is spared in preparing an illustrative experiment,
although such experiment may be demonstrated in a
minute or less.</p>

<p>It may be appropriate, while considering the long
connection of Faraday with the scene of his many
experimental triumphs, to refer more particularly to that
unique meeting which took place last summer (June 8th,
1891) in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the
birth of Faraday, and to which slight reference is made
in the last chapter. The meeting, appropriately enough,
took the form of a gathering in the theatre of the Royal
Institution of many of the most able and distinguished
chemists of the day; Lord Rayleigh delivering an
address on the developments of Faraday's discoveries.
The chair was taken by His Royal Highness the Prince
of Wales, who referred in his opening remarks to the
time when he had sat in that theatre and listened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Faraday himself. The letter from H.R.H., which is
quoted on p. 131, was read, as was also the following
letter which the Prince wrote to Mrs. Faraday on the
occasion of her husband's death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="marginright">
"Wiesbaden, September 10, 1867.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Faraday,&mdash;Although I have not the
pleasure of knowing you, I cannot resist sending you a
few lines to tell you how deeply grieved and distressed
I am to hear of the death of your husband, Professor
Faraday. Having had the great pleasure of knowing
him for some years, and having heard his interesting
lectures when quite a boy, I can fully appreciate how
great the loss must be, not only to you, but to the
whole country at large, where his name was deeply
venerated by all classes. His name will not only be
remembered as a great and distinguished scientific man,
but also as a good man, whose excellent and amiable
qualities were so universally known. Pardon my
trespassing so soon on your great grief, and believe me,
dear Mrs. Faraday, yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="marginright">
"<span class="smcap">Albert Edward.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very interesting yet pathetic letter was read from
Dr. Tyndall, which, coming as it did from a man who
had so well known and so thoroughly appreciated
Faraday, is of great interest to us. "As Faraday
recedes from me in time," wrote Tyndall, "he becomes
to me more and more beautiful. Anything, therefore,
calculated to do honour to his memory must command
my entire sympathy. But the utmost liberty I can now
allow myself is to be shifted from my bed to a couch, and
wheeled to a position near the window, from which I
can see the bloom of the gorse and the brown of the
heather. Thus, considerations affecting the body only
present an insuperable barrier to my going to London on
Wednesday."</p>

<p>Not very far from Albemarle Street, is Blandford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Street, where it will be remembered Michael Faraday
began the battle of life as a newsboy. Mr. Riebau's
shop (No. 2) is yet standing, and is still a stationer's
and bookseller's. Over the shop front is now to be
observed a plaque, on which are the simple words,
"Michael Faraday, Man of Science, apprentice here,
1791-1867." Professor Tyndall tells us of a pleasing
story of a visit which he paid with the ex-bookbinder to
this scene of his early labours. "Mr. Faraday and myself
quitted the Institution one evening together, to pay
a visit in Baker Street. He took my arm at the door,
and pressing it to his side in his warm genial way, said,
'Come, Tyndall, I will now show you something that
will interest you.' We reached Blandford Street; and
after a little looking about, he paused before a stationer's
shop, and then went in. On entering the shop, his
usual animation seemed doubled; he looked rapidly at
everything it contained. To the left on entering was a
door, through which he looked down into a little room,
with a window in front facing Blandford Street. Drawing
me toward him, he said eagerly, 'Look there, Tyndall,
that was my working-place. I bound books in that
little nook.' A respectable-looking woman stood
behind the counter; his conversation with me was too
low to be heard by her, and he now turned to the
counter to buy some cards as an excuse for our being
there. He asked the woman her name&mdash;her predecessor's
name&mdash;his predecessor's name. 'That won't do,' he
said, with good-humoured impatience; 'who was his
predecessor?' 'Mr. Riebau,' she replied, and immediately
added, as if suddenly recollecting herself, 'He, sir, was
the master of Sir Charles Faraday!' 'Nonsense!' he
responded, 'there is no such person!' Great was her
delight when I told her the name of her visitor; but she
assured me that as soon as she saw him running about
the shop, she felt&mdash;though she did not know why&mdash;that
it must be <em>Sir Charles Faraday</em>!"</p>

<p>Turning to our right on coming out of No. 2, Blandford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Street, we shall notice on the opposite side of the
way a small turning down under an archway. That
turning is the beginning of Jacob's Well Mews, where
the Faraday family lived, and of which an illustration
has been given on an earlier page of this book. The
place is interesting and worthy of a visit, as showing
us that however poor and unpromising may be the
surroundings of a man's childhood, he may yet
win for himself an enduring name, as has Michael
Faraday, not only in the annals of his own country, but
in those of knowledge&mdash;whose annals are concerned not
with one, but with all countries.</p>

<p>A most interesting and pleasant trip, too, may be taken
to Hampton Court Green, where a visit can be paid
to the house, the use of which Her Majesty the Queen
so kindly gave to the Professor, and where he passed the
greater part of the last ten years of his life. Of the
very many visitors to the famous palace and gardens of
Hampton Court, there are, I fear, not a very large
proportion who notice the charming little house facing
the Green, and not far from the entrance to the Palace
where the Professor lived. "Faraday House," however,
appears much the same as it did when he whose name
it now bears was living there. With its front all overgrown
with ivy and Virginian creeper, with its creeper-bowered
archway from the gate to the front door, with
its trees and shrubs all along the front, and with its view
across the Green to the trees in the Palace grounds
beyond, the old-fashioned house has a delightful aspect,
and seems indeed an ideal spot to which a man of
Faraday's simple, unpretentious, yet nature-loving
character, could retire after a long life of arduous and
useful work.</p>

<p>The following "in memoriam" poem, which appeared in
the pages of <cite>Punch</cite> shortly after Faraday's death, so
beautifully sums up much of the man's life and character,
that it may be fittingly quoted as a conclusion to
this short account of the life of the illustrious philosopher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a life which must impress all who have studied it as
one of the purest and most unselfish of which we have
any record.</p>

as a lecturer: "I doubt his unconcern, but his fearlessness was often
manifested. It used to rise within him as a wave, which carried
both him and his audience along with it. On rare occasions also,
when he felt himself and his subject hopelessly unintelligible, he
suddenly evoked a certain recklessness of thought; and without
halting to extricate his bewildered followers, he would dash alone
through the jungle into which he had unwittingly led them; thus
saving them from ennui by the exhibition of a vigour which, for the
time being, they could neither share nor comprehend."</p></div>
